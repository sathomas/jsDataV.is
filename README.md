# Data Visualization Web Site (jsDataV.is)

Repository for http://jsDataV.is web site.

The site is mostly built using [CodeKit](https://incident57.com/codekit/index.html) but there is a Makefile included to convert Markdown files into appropriate HTML fragments (since CodeKit insists on using Discount and this site relies on features only available in pandoc).
