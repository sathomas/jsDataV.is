<h1 id="chapter-5-showing-time-lines">Chapter 5: Showing Time Lines</h1>
<p>The most compelling visualizations often succeed because they tell a story; they extract a narrative from data and reveal that narrative to their users. And as with any narrative, <em>time</em> is a critical component. If our data consists solely of numbers, a standard bar or line chart can easily show its evolution over time. If our data is not numerical, however, standard charts probably won’t work. This chapter considers several alternatives for time-based visualizations. All are based on some variation of a time line; one linear dimension represents time, and events are places along that dimension based on when they occurred. In all of the examples we’ll consider the same underlying data, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronology_of_Shakespeare%27s_plays">possible chronology of the plays of William Shakespeare</a>.</p>
<p>We’ll look at three very different approaches for adding time lines to web pages. One option relies on a JavaScript library, and it follows a process similar to many other visualizations in the book. The other two techniques, however, offer a different perspective. In one, we won’t use a visualization library at all. Instead we’ll build a time line with basic JavaScript, <span class="smcp">HTML</span>, and <span class="smcp">CSS</span>, and we’ll see how to do that both with and without jQuery. The final example shows the other extreme. It relies on a full featured web component available from an external web site. In short, we’ll look at:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to use a library to create time lines.</li>
<li>How to create timelines without a library using only JavaScript, <span class="smcp">HTML</span>, and <span class="smcp">CSS</span>.</li>
<li>How to integrate a time line component in a web page.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="building-time-lines-with-a-library">Building Time Lines with a Library</h2>
<p>First, we’ll build the timeline using the <a href="http://stoicloofah.github.io/chronoline.js/">Chronoline.js</a> library, which works a lot like most of the other JavaScript libraries we’ve used in the book. You include the library in your page, define your data, and let the library create the visualization.</p>
<h3 id="step-1-include-the-required-libraries">Step 1: Include the Required Libraries</h3>
<p>The Chronoline.js library itself depends on a few other libraries, and we’ll need to include all of them in our pages.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://jquery.com">jQuery</a></li>
<li><a href="http://qtip2.com">qTip2</a> (including its style sheet)</li>
<li><a href="http://raphaeljs.com">Raphaël</a></li>
</ul>
<p>All of these libraries are popular enough for public content distribution networks to support, so we’ll use CloudFlare’s <span class="smcp">CDN</span> in the markup below. We’ll have to use our own resources, however, to host the Chronoline.js itself. That library also defines its own style sheet.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: Chapter 2 includes a more extensive discussion of content distributions networks and the trade-offs involved in using them.</p>

<p>Before we can use Chronoline.js, we have to convert the raw data into the format the library expects. Since we have jQuery available, we can take advantage of its <code>.map()</code> function for the conversion. (For details on <code>.map()</code>, see chapter 2.)</p>

<p>As you can see from our data set, some of the plays have a single year as their date, while others have a range of years (two dates separated by a dash). To set the date range for Chronoline.js, we check for a dash on line 4. If one is present, we split the date string at that dash and set a multi-year range in line 6. Otherwise we set the range to a single year in line 9.</p>

<h3 id="step-3-draw-the-time-line">Step 3: Draw the Time Line</h3>
<p>To draw the time line, we create a new <code>Chronoline</code> object, passing it the <span class="smcp">HTML</span> container element, our event data, and any options. The <span class="smcp">HTML</span> container element should be a native element and not a jQuery selection. To convert from a selection to a native element, we use the <code>get()</code> method. In this case we want the first element, we use the parameter <code>0</code>.</p>

}</code></pre></td></tr></table>
<p>If we try to use the default options of Chronoline.js with our data, however, the result is quite disappointing. (In fact, it’s illegible and not worth reproducing at this point.) We can fix that in the next step with some additional options.</p>
<h3 id="step-4-set-chronoline.js-options-for-the-data">Step 4: Set Chronoline.js Options for the Data</h3>
<p>The Chronoline.js library has default options that are well-suited for its original application, but they don’t work so well for Shakespeare’s plays. Fortunately, we can change the options from the default values. As of this writing, Chronoline.js doesn’t have much documentation on its options; to see the full set you would normally have to examine the source code. We’ll cover the most important options below, though.</p>
<p>One of the most obvious problems with Chonoline.js’ defaults is the date shown in the initial view. Chronoline.js starts by displaying the current date by default. Since our time line ends in 1613, the user would have to scroll backwards for a long time to see anything meaningful. We can change this view by giving Chronoline.js a different start date for the initial view:</p>
<table class="sourceCode javascript numberLines"><tr class="sourceCode"><td class="lineNumbers"><pre>1
</pre></td><td class="sourceCode"><pre><code class="sourceCode javascript">defaultStartDate: <span class="kw">new</span> <span class="fu">Date</span>(<span class="dv">1589</span>, <span class="dv">0</span>, <span class="dv">1</span>),</code></pre></td></tr></table>
<p>As long as we’re setting the time line to start somewhere close to Shakespeare’s lifetime, there’s no need for Chronoline.js to add a special mark for the current date. Tell it not to bother with a simple option:</p>
<table class="sourceCode javascript numberLines"><tr class="sourceCode"><td class="lineNumbers"><pre>1
</pre></td><td class="sourceCode"><pre><code class="sourceCode javascript">markToday: <span class="kw">false</span>,</code></pre></td></tr></table>
<p>The next major problem we’ll want to address is the labeling. By default, Chronoline.js tries to label every day on the time line. As our events span 24 years, we don’t need that granularity. Instead, we can tell Chronoline just to label the years. For the same reason we also need to change the tick marks. Instead of every day, we only need tick marks for every month.</p>
<p>To change both of these options, we supply Chronoline.js with a pair of functions to call. Chronoline.js passes each of these functions a date object, and the functions return <code>true</code> or <code>false</code> depending on whether or not the date merits a tick mark or label. For tick marks we return <code>true</code> only on the first day of the month. We return <code>true</code> for labels only on January 1. (Remember that JavaScript numbers months beginning with <code>0</code>.)</p>
<table class="sourceCode javascript numberLines"><tr class="sourceCode"><td class="lineNumbers"><pre>1
2
3
4

6
</pre></td><td class="sourceCode"><pre><code class="sourceCode javascript">hashInterval: <span class="kw">function</span>(date) {
    <span class="kw">return</span> <span class="ot">date</span>.<span class="fu">getDate</span>() === <span class="dv">1</span>;
},
labelInterval: <span class="kw">function</span>(date) {
    <span class="kw">return</span> <span class="ot">date</span>.<span class="fu">getMonth</span>() === <span class="dv">0</span> &amp;&amp; <span class="ot">date</span>.<span class="fu">getDate</span>() === <span class="dv">1</span>;
},</code></pre></td></tr></table>
<p>By default Chronoline.js will try to show a full date for each label. Since we only want to label each year, we’ll change the label format to just show the year. The details for the format specification are based on a standard <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/ctime/strftime/">C++ library</a>.</p>
<table class="sourceCode javascript numberLines"><tr class="sourceCode"><td class="lineNumbers"><pre>1
</pre></td><td class="sourceCode"><pre><code class="sourceCode javascript">labelFormat: <span class="st">&quot;%Y&quot;</span>,</code></pre></td></tr></table>
<p>For our last adjustments to the labeling, we remove the “sub-labels” and “sub-sub-labels” that Chronoline.js adds by default. Those labels don’t provide any value in our case.</p>
<table class="sourceCode javascript numberLines"><tr class="sourceCode"><td class="lineNumbers"><pre>1
2
</pre></td><td class="sourceCode"><pre><code class="sourceCode javascript">subLabel: <span class="kw">null</span>,
subSubLabel: <span class="kw">null</span>,</code></pre></td></tr></table>
<p>We also want to change the span of time that Chronoline.js displays in the time line. For our data, showing a span of 5 years at a time seems good.</p>
<table class="sourceCode javascript numberLines"><tr class="sourceCode"><td class="lineNumbers"><pre>1
</pre></td><td class="sourceCode"><pre><code class="sourceCode javascript">visibleSpan: DAY_IN_MILLISECONDS * <span class="dv">366</span> * <span class="dv">5</span>,</code></pre></td></tr></table>
<p>Note that the variable <code>DAY_IN_MILLISECONDS</code> is defined by Chronoline.js itself. We’re free to use it in this or in any other option setting.</p>
<p>Now we can address the time line scrolling. Chronoline.js normally advances the time line by a single day with each click. That would result in some rather tedious scrolling for our users. Instead of the default behavior, we’ll have Chronoline.js advance by a full year. As with the labels, we change this behavior by supplying Chronoline.js with a function. That function is passed a date object and it should return a new date object to which Chronoline.js should scroll. In our case we simply add or subtract one from the year value.</p>
<table class="sourceCode javascript numberLines"><tr class="sourceCode"><td class="lineNumbers"><pre>1

</pre></td><td class="sourceCode"><pre><code class="sourceCode javascript">scrollLeft: <span class="kw">function</span>(date) {

},</code></pre></td></tr></table>
<p>The last few adjustments clean up the appearance and behavior of Chronoline.js. Adding a bit of extra space (in our case 3 months) before the start and after the end of the timeline give the data a bit of room.</p>
<table class="sourceCode javascript numberLines"><tr class="sourceCode"><td class="lineNumbers"><pre>1
</pre></td><td class="sourceCode"><pre><code class="sourceCode javascript">timelinePadding: DAY_IN_MILLISECONDS * <span class="dv">366</span> / <span class="dv">4</span>,</code></pre></td></tr></table>
<p>We can also make the scrolling animate smoothly instead of jumping, give users the ability to drag the timeline right or left, and improve the default browser tool tips.</p>

Additionally, Stanley Wells argues that the scenes involving more than four characters, \"betray an uncertainty of technique suggestive of inexperience.\" As such, the play is considered to be one of the first Shakespeare composed upon arriving in London (Roger Warren, following E.A.J. Honigmann, suggests he may have written it prior to his arrival) and, as such, he lacked theatrical experience. This places the date of composition as most likely somewhere between 1589 and 1591, by which time it is known he was working on the Henry VI plays" },

This could have been either the 1594 A Shrew or the Shakespearean The Shrew, but as the Admiral's Men and the Lord Chamberlain's Men were sharing the theatre at the time, and as such Shakespeare himself would have been there, scholars tend to assume that it was The Shrew. The Shakespearean version was definitely performed at court before King Charles I and Queen Henrietta Maria on 26 November 1633, where it was described as being \"liked'.", "evidence": "Kier Elam posits a date of 1591 as a terminus post quem for the composition of The Shrew, based on Shakespeare's probable use of two sources published that year; Abraham Ortelius's map of Italy in the Theatrum Orbis Terrarum (4th ed.) and John Florio's Second Fruits. However, scholars continue to debate the relationship between the 1594 A Shrew and the 1623 The Shrew. Some theorise that A Shrew is a reported text, meaning The Shrew must have been written prior to 2 May 1594; others, that A Shrew is an early draft, meaning The Shrew must have been completed sometime after 2 May 1594. There are also arguments that A Shrew may have been a source for The Shrew, that they could be two completely unrelated plays based on the same (now lost) source (the \"Ur-Shrew\" theory), or A Shrew could be an adaptation of The Shrew. Critics remain divided on this issue, and as such, dating the play is extremely difficult." },

Benson directed a production at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre.", "evidence": "It is known that the play was definitely on stage by early 1592 as in A Groatsworth of Wit, Bought with a Million of Repentance, Robert Greene mocked Shakespeare by parodying a line from 3 Henry VI. Groatsworth was registered in the Stationers' Register in September 1592, meaning True Tragedy/3 Henry VI must have been on stage prior to 23 June 1592 as that was when the government shut the London theatres due to an outbreak of plague. To have been on stage by June 1592, the play was most likely written some time in 1591." },

In August, Thomas Nashe published Piers Penniless his Supplication to the Devil, in which he refers to a play he had recently seen featuring a rousing depiction of Lord Talbot, a major character in 1 Henry VI. Most critics take Nashe's reference to Talbot as proof that the play Henslowe saw was 1 Henry VI. As such, to have been a new play in March 1592, it was most likely written some time in 1591. Furthermore, many critics consider 1 Henry VI to have been written as a prequel to the successful two-part play, The Contention and True Tragedy. Possibly co-written with Thomas Nashe and/or other unidentified dramatists." },

As such, the play must have been composed some time prior to September. Additionally, it is unlikely to have been written later than June 1592, as that was when the London theatres were closed due to an outbreak of plague. The theatres would remain shut for the better part of two years, not fully reopening until March 1594 and Shakespeare concentrated most of his energies during this period on poetry. As such, the play was most likely composed sometime between late-1591 and early 1592. Possibly co-written with George Peele" },

Containing, his treacherous plots against his brother Clarence: the pittiefull murther of his innocent nephewes: his tyrannicall usurpation: with the whole course of his detested life, and most deserved death. The Folio text appears under the title The Tragedy of Richard the Third, with the Landing of Earle Richmond, and the Battell at Bosworth Field.", "performance": "The play was performed extensively in Shakespeare's lifetime; it is mentioned in Palladis Tamia in 1598 (as \"Richard the 3.'), and by the time of the First Folio in 1623, had been published in quarto six times (1597, 1598, 1603, 1605, 1612 and 1622), and referenced by multiple writers of the day. Regarding specific performances however, there is little solid evidence. In 1602, John Manningham mentions seeing Richard Burbage playing the role of Richard III, but he offers no further information. The earliest definite performance was at St James's Palace on 16 or 17 November 1633 by the King's Men.", "evidence": "It is known that Richard III was definitely a sequel to 3 Henry VI, which was on-stage by 23 June 1592, hence Richard III must have been written later than early 1592. Additionally, it has been argued that the play contains evidence suggesting it was originally written for Strange's Men, but then rewritten for Pembroke's Men, a company which formed in mid-1592. Also, with the closure of the theatres due to an outbreak of plague in June 1592, the play was unlikely to have been written any later than that, all of which suggests a date of composition as sometime in early-1592." },

However, this production presented only the first half of the play (dealing with the King's infatuation with the Countess of Salisbury). Performed under the title, The King and the Countess, it was presented in a single matinée performance with the anonymous sixteenth century liturgical drama, Jacob and Esau. The first known performance of the complete text took place in June 1987, at the Theatr Clwyd, directed by Toby Robertson.", "evidence": "Obviously, the play was written by December 1595. According to the title page of the quarto, it had been performed recently in London, but no company information is provided. This could mean that the company that performed the play had disbanded during the closure of the theatres from June 1592 to March 1594. Furthermore, internal evidence suggests that the play may have been specifically written for Pembroke's Men, who ceased performing in September 1593. This places the date of composition as most likely somewhere between early 1592 and September 1593." },
  { "play": "The Comedy of Errors",            "date": "1594",      "record": "Francis Meres' Palladis Tamia (1598); referred to as \"Errors\"", "published": "First Folio (1623)", "performance": "probably on Innocents Day, 28 December 1594 at Gray's Inn (one of the four London Inns of Court). The only known evidence for this performance is the Gesta Grayorum, a 1688 text printed for William Canning based on a manuscript apparently handed down from the 1590s, detailing the \"Prince of Purpoole\" festival from December 1594 to February 1595.[c] According to the text, after a disastrous attempt to stage \"some notable performance [...] it was thought good not to offer any thing of Account, saving Dancing and Revelling with Gentlewomen; and after such Sports, a Comedy of Errors (like to Plautus his Menaechmus) was played by the Players. So that Night was begun, and continued to the end, in nothing but Confusion and Errors; whereupon, it was ever afterwards called, The Night of Errors.\" As Comedy of Errors is indeed based on Menaechmus, this is almost universally accepted as a reference to an otherwise unrecorded performance of the play, probably by Shakespeare's own company, the newly formed Lord Chamberlain's Men.", "evidence": "traditionally, the play has been dated quite early (Ros King, for example, dates it 1586-1589), and has often been seen as Shakespeare's first comedy, perhaps his first play. However, stylistic and linguistic analysis (proportion of verse to prose, amount of rhyme, use of colloquialism in verse, and a rare word test) has placed it closer to the composition of Richard II and Romeo and Juliet, both of which were written in 1594 or 1595. More specifically, the limited setting (it is one of only two Shakespeare plays to observe the Classical unities) and the brevity of the play (Shakespeare's shortest at 1777 lines), along with the great abundance of legal terminology, suggests to some critics the probability of it being written especially for the Gray's Inn performance, which would place its composition in the latter half of 1594. If it was written for Gray's Inn, it most likely represents the first play by Shakespeare which was specifically commissioned. In this case, that commission could have come from Henry Wriothesley, Earl of Southampton, a member of the Inns of Court, and Shakespeare's patron." },
  { "play": "Love's Labour's Lost",            "date": "1594-1595", "record": "a version of the play was published in quarto in 1598, although the exact date is unknown as it was never entered into the Stationers' Register. Also in 1598, Robert Tofte mentioned the play in his sonnet sequence Alba. The months minde of a melancholy lover; \"Love's Labour Lost, I once did see, a play/Y'cleped so, so called to my pain.\" The date of publication of Alba is unknown as it also was not entered into the Register. Additionally, the play is mentioned in Meres' Palladis Tamia (registered on 7 September, with a dedication dated 10 October). It is unknown exactly which one of these three constitutes the first official record of the play.", "published": "version of the play published in quarto in 1598 as A Pleasant Conceited Comedie called Loves labors lost (the first known printing of a Shakespearean play to include his name on the title page). The Folio text appears under the title Love's Labour's lost.", "performance": "according to the quarto title page, the play was performed at court for Queen Elizabeth sometime over Christmas 1597, however, no further information is provided. The earliest definite performance took place some time between 8 and 15 January 1605, for Anne of Denmark, at either Henry Wriothesley or Robert Cecil's house.", "evidence": "Obviously, the play was written by Christmas 1597, but narrowing the date further has proved difficult, with most efforts focusing upon stylistic evidence. Traditionally, it was seen as one of Shakespeare's earliest plays (Charles Gildon wrote in 1710; \"since it is one of the worst of Shakespeare's Plays, nay I think I may say the very worst, I cannot but think it is his first.') For much of the eighteenth century, it tended to be dated 1590, until Malone's newly constructed chronology in 1778, which dated it 1594. In his 1930 chronology, E.K. Chambers found the play to be more sophisticated than Malone had allowed for, and dated it 1595. Today most scholars tend to concur with a date of 1594-1595, and the play is often grouped with the \"lyrical plays'; Richard II, Romeo and Juliet and A Midsummer Night's Dream, because of its prolific use of rhyming. These four plays are argued to represent a phase of Shakespeare's career where he was experimenting with rhyming iambic pentameter as an alternative form to standard blank verse; Richard II has more rhymed verse than any other history play (19.1%), Romeo and Juliet more than any other tragedy (16.6%) and Love's Labour's and Midsummer Night more than any other comedy (43.1% and 45.5% respectively). All four tend to be dated to 1594/1595. In support of this, Ants Oras' pause test places the play after Richard III, which is usually dated 1592. Furthermore, Taylor finds possible allusions to the Gray's Inn revels of December 1594 (specifically the Muscovite masque in Act 5, Scene 2), and also finds plausible Geoffrey Bullough's argument that the satire of the King of Navarre (loosely based on Henry of Navarre, who was associated with oath breaking after abjuring Protestantism in 1593) favours a date after December 1594, when Henry survived an assassination attempt." },
  { "play": "Love's Labour's Won",             "date": "1595-1596", "record": "Francis Meres' Palladis Tamia (1598); referred to as \"Love labours wonne\"", "published": "published in quarto some time prior to 1603", "performance": "there are no recorded performances of the play", "evidence": "There are only two known references to this play. One is in Meres' Palladis Tamia, the other is on a list by Christopher Hunt, dated August 1603, which gives a list of published plays sold by an Exeter bookseller. Up until 1953, only Meres' reference was known, until Hunt's two pages of handwriting were discovered in the backing of a copy of Thomas Gataker's Certaine Sermones. The discovery was handed over to T.W. Baldwin, who published his findings in 1957 as Shakespeare's Love's Labour's Won. The title suggests the play was written as a sequel to Love's Labour's Lost, which is partially supported by the unusually open-ended nature of that play, hence Love's Labour's Won's position in the Oxford chronology. However, whether the play ever existed has been debated, with some critics speculating that it is simply another name for one of Shakespeare's known plays, a situation similar to Henry VIII, which was originally performed with the title All is True. As Meres refers to The Two Gentlemen of Verona, The Comedy of Errors and The Merchant of Venice, prior to the discovery of the Hunt reference, a common suggestion was The Taming of the Shrew, but as Hunt mentions this play, it could not be Love's Labour's Won. Although Much Ado About Nothing, All's Well That Ends Well and Troilus and Cressida have also been cited as possibilities, these plays tend to be dated later than 1598 (much later in the case of Troilus, although the argument is that Love's Labour's Won is an early draft), and as there are no other pre-1598 Shakespearean comedies with which to equate it, it seems certain that the play did exist, that it was performed and published, but that it has since been lost." },
  { "play": "Richard II",                      "date": "1595",      "record": "entered into the Stationers' Register on 29 August 1597 as \"the Tragedye of Richard the Second'.", "published": "version of the play published in quarto in 1597 as The Tragedie of King Richard the second (republished in 1598 (twice), 1608 and 1615). The Folio text appears under the title The life and death of King Richard the Second", "performance": "possible performance on 9 December 1595 at Sir Edward Hoby's house. Hoby's wife, the daughter of Baron Hunsdon (chief patron of the Lord Chamberlain's Men), wrote a letter to Sir Robert Cecil inviting him to supper and to see \"K. Richard present him self to your vewe.\" Many scholars see this as a reference to Richard II, especially because of the Hunsdon connection with Shakespeare's company. However, some scholars argue that the reference could be to a painting, not a play, whilst others argue there is no evidence that \"K. Richard\" necessarily refers to Richard II, suggesting it could refer to Richard III or to another play entirely. There is no complete consensus on this issue, although most scholars do tend to favour the Richard II theory. The earliest definite performance was at the Globe Theatre on 7 February 1601, organised by the Earl of Essex in a performance probably intended to inspire his supporters on the eve of his armed rebellion against Queen Elizabeth. According to testimony given by actor Augustine Phillips at Essex' trial for treason, he paid the Lord Chamberlain's Men forty shillings more than the standard rate to stage the play.", "evidence": "Richard II is usually seen as one of the \"lyrical plays', along with Love's Labour's Lost, Romeo and Juliet and A Midsummer Night's Dream; four plays in which Shakespeare used rhymed iambic pentameter more than anywhere else in his career. The four plays also include elaborate punning, rhetorical patterning, a general avoidance of colloquialisms and a high volume of metrical regularity. All four of these plays tend to be dated to 1594-1595. Also important in dating the play is Samuel Daniel's The First Four Books of the Civil Wars, which was entered into the Stationers' Register on 11 October 1594, and published in early 1595. Although some scholars have suggested that Daniel used Shakespeare as a source, which would mean the play was written somewhat earlier than 1594, most agree that Shakespeare used Daniel, especially in some of the later scenes, meaning the play could not have been written earlier than 1595." },

In addition, Salarino's reference to \"my wealthy Andrew docked in sand\" is thought to refer to the San Andréas, a Spanish merchant vessel that ran aground in Essex in June 1596.

Furthermore, evidence in the quarto text suggests that Shakespeare originally wrote the role of Dogberry for William Kempe, however, records indicate that Kempe left the Lord Chamberlain's Men sometime in late 1598, so the play must have been written before then. As such, it was most likely composed sometime in the latter half of 1598 and was certainly completed before the new year." },

A reference by the Chorus to the Earl of Essex's Irish expedition of 1599 means the play was most likely written sometime between March 1599 (when Essex left for Ireland) and September 1599 (when he returned)." },

In addition, because the play is not mentioned in Meres' Palladis Tamia, registered in September 1598, it was unlikely to have been performed prior to then. This places the date of composition as somewhere between September 1598 and September 1599. Additionally, textual analysis has connected the play to Henry V, which was almost certainly written in 1599, suggesting so too was Julius Caesar." },

The title page of the first quarto states that it had been performed in London, at the two universities of Cambridge and Oxford, \"and else-where', presumably on tour in the provinces. The first definite dated performance took place on a ship anchored off the coast of Africa in September 1607, the Red Dragon. The play was performed by the crew.", "evidence": "Because the versions of Hamlet which appeared in 1603, in 1604 (again in quarto) and in the First Folio of 1623 differ so much from one another, dating the play is exceptionally difficult. There is also the problem of the Ur-Hamlet, a possible source used by Shakespeare, now lost. Others however, feel that Ur-Hamlet (if it ever existed) was most likely an early draft. Hamlet was written sometime between September 1598 (as it was not included in Meres' Palladis Tamia) and July 1602 (when it was registered in the Stationers Register). Furthermore, internal references to Julius Caesar would indicate the play could not have been written any earlier than September 1599. Additionally, in his 1598 copy of an edition of Geoffrey Chaucer's works, Gabriel Harvey has written that Shakespeare's \"Lucrece & his tragedie of Hamlet, prince of Denmarke, have it in them, to please the wiser sort'. Harvey also mentions the Earl of Essex as still alive, which would suggest he wrote the note prior to 25 February 1601, when Essex was executed. This would seem to narrow the date of composition to between September 1599 and February 1601; however, not all scholars accept the veracity of Harvey's note. Internal evidence in the play has also been cited, usually as illustrative of a date of composition of 1600 or 1601. As such, many scholars interpret the available evidence as suggestive of a date of initial composition sometime in 1600, with subsequent revisions. This dating, however, is far from universally accepted." },

Obviously the play was written (in some form) prior to December 1604. The only other evidence are possible topical references within the play itself which would seem to indicate a date most likely in 1602, but this is not universally accepted by all scholars. Furthermore, there is a theory that Thomas Middleton rewrote the play after Shakespeare's death, possibly in 1621, which throws further doubt on the exact date of initial composition." },

Additionally, scholars generally agree that the play is indebted to Samuel Harsnett's Declaration of Egregious Popish Impostures (entered into the Stationers' Register on 16 March 1603) and John Florio's 1603 translation of Montaigne's Essays., placing the date of composition as somewhere between March 1603 and December 1606. A further possible source for the play has evoked some disagreement however. Whilst many scholars feel that Shakespeare used the anonymous play The True Chronicle History of King Leir (entered into the Stationers' Register on 8 May 1605), and hence must have been written between May 1605 and December 1606, others argue that the relationship between the two plays has been inverted, and The True Chronicle History of King Leir was actually written to capitalise on the success of Shakespeare's play, which was probably written in 1603 or 1604. No real critical consensus has been reached regarding this disagreement." },

There is no reference to the play whatsoever prior to 1623, and as such, evidence for its date of composition must come from within the play itself. Taylor concludes that Middleton and Shakespeare were jointly responsible for the play and assigns the composition date to 1605 on the basis of previous analyses of colloquialism-in-verse and rare vocabulary." },
  { "play": "Macbeth",                         "date": "1606",      "record": "possibly by Simon Forman, who records seeing the play in April 1611. However, there is considerable debate amongst scholars as to whether Forman's account is genuine", "published": "First Folio (1623) as The Tragedie of Macbeth", "performance": "possibly in April 1611, recorded by Simon Forman", "evidence": "Scholars place the date of composition as somewhere between 1603 and 1607, but efforts to narrow that date have proved inconclusive. Several possible topical references to the Gunpowder Plot of 1605 have been proposed and debated among scholars, but these references have not been universally accepted. In 1790, Edward Malone dated the play to 1606, and the vast majority of critics agree with this date even while acknowledging that little conclusive evidence exists, though the date seems correct in the context of Shakespeare's other work of the period. One suggested allusion supporting a date in late 1606 is the first witch's dialogue about a sailor's wife: \"'Aroint thee, witch!\" the rump-fed ronyon cries./Her husband's to Aleppo gone, master o' the Tiger\" (1.6-7). This has been thought to allude to the Tiger, a ship that returned to England 27 June 1606 after a disastrous voyage in which many of the crew were killed by pirates. A few lines later the witch speaks of the sailor, \"He shall live a man forbid:/Weary se'nnights nine times nine\" (1.21-2). The real ship was at sea 567 days, the product of 7x9x9, which has been taken as a confirmation of the allusion, which if correct, confirms that the play could not have been written any earlier than July 1606. A. R. Braunmuller, however, in the New Cambridge edition, finds the 1605-6 arguments inconclusive, and argues only for an earliest date of 1603. Further complicating the dating of Macbeth is the fact that the play shows evidence of later revisions by Middleton, particularly in the witch scenes." },

It first appears together with Shakespeare's other plays in the second issue of the Third Folio of 1664. In a contested field, the most widely accepted theory today is that Shakespeare collaborated on the play with another playwright, probably his younger colleague, George Wilkins. There is no complete agreement what the motives or mechanism of this collaboration were. In 1608, Wilkins published a prose narrative of Pericles purporting to be a narrative version of the play and which contains numerous phrases that seem to recall specific lines in the play, suggesting that work on the play preceded his composition of the prose version. Textual analysis of the play has suggested it be placed as in some close relation with All's Well That Ends Well and Coriolanus, which would confirm a date of 1607-1608." },

Shakespeare's treatment of the grain riots is strikingly reminiscent of the Midlands corn riots of 1607. Though Menenius' fable of the belly was used in other contemporary works, the wording of Menenius's speech about the body politic is derived from William Camden's Remaines (1605). Two possible echoes of George Chapman's Iliad (registered 14 November 1608) support a date of 1608-9. A reference to \"the coal of fire upon ice\" (1.1.170) is a possible allusion to the winter of 1607-08, when the frost was so severe that vendors set up booths on the frozen Thames river and pans of coals were placed on the ice so that pedestrians could warm themselves. An allusion to the complaints about Hugh Myddelton's project to bring water to London has also been detected in Martius' warning to the patricians (3.1.98-9). Taylor says that the cumulative internal evidence all points to a composition date of no earlier than spring of 1608, while others favour late 1608 to early 1609. Several allusions in other works establish a terminal date of composition: Ben Jonson's Epicœne, or The silent woman, composed in late 1609, mocks a peculiar phrase in the play, and Phantasma (registered 6 February 1609), written by Robert Armin, a member of the King's Men from 1599 to 1610, contains a close literary parallel. Critics also suggest that the regular act intervals indicate that it could have been written for the indoor Blackfriars Theatre, which Shakespeare's company acquired in 1608." },

<h2 id="building-time-lines-with-javascript">Building Time Lines with JavaScript</h2>
<p>If you followed the example in the previous section, you might not be completely satisfied with the results. We did end up with an accurate time line of Shakespeare’s plays, but the resulting visualization may not be communicating what you want. For example, the time line doesn’t show the names of the plays unless the user hovers a mouse over that section of the graph. Perhaps we’d rather have the plays’ titles always visible. That kind of problem is a limitation of third-party libraries. The author of Chronoline.js didn’t see the need for displaying titles, so he didn’t offer the option. And unless we’re willing to take on the potentially daunting task of modifying the library’s source code, we can’t make the library do exactly what we want.</p>
<p>Fortunately, particularly in the case of time lines, we can take a completely different approach. We can create visualizations without using any third party library at all. With this approach we’ll have total control over the result. Time lines are especially amenable to this technique because they can be created with nothing more than text and styling. All it takes is a basic understanding of <span class="smcp">HTML</span> and <span class="smcp">CSS</span>, plus enough JavaScript to set things up and perhaps provide simple interactions.</p>
<p>That’s exactly what we’ll do in this example. We’ll start with the same data set as before. Instead of feeding that data into a third-party library, however, we’ll use plain old JavaScript (with an optional dose of jQuery) to construct a pure <span class="smcp">HTML</span> representation of the data. Then we’ll use <span class="smcp">CSS</span> to set the appearance of the time line.</p>
<h3 id="step-1-prepare-the-html-skeleton">Step 1: Prepare the HTML Skeleton</h3>
<p>Without any required libraries, the <span class="smcp">HTML</span> page for our timeline is pretty simple. All we need is a containing <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> with a unique <code>id</code> attribute in line 8.</p>

<h3 id="step-3-create-the-time-line-in-semantic-html">Step 3: Create the Time Line in Semantic HTML</h3>
<p>To create the timeline in <span class="smcp">HTML</span>, we first need to decide how to represent it. If you’re used to working with arbitrary <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> elements, you might think that’s the best approach here as well. Instead of jumping right to these generic elements, however, it’s worth considering other <span class="smcp">HTML</span> structures that more accurately convey the content. <span class="lgcp">HTML</span> that more closely reflects the meaning of the underlying content is known as <em>semantic markup</em>, and it’s usually preferred over generic <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> tags. Semantic markup exposes the meaning of your content to computers such as search engines and screen readers for users with visual impairments, and it can improve your site’s search rank and its accessibility. If we think about a time line in the context of semantic markup, it’s easy to see that the time line is really just a list. In fact, it’s a list with a specific order. We should build our <span class="smcp">HTML</span> time line, therefore, as an ordered list (<code>&lt;ol&gt;</code>) element. While we’re creating the <code>&lt;ol&gt;</code> we can also give it a class name for <span class="smcp">CSS</span> style rules we’ll be adding later.</p>
<table class="sourceCode javascript numberLines"><tr class="sourceCode"><td class="lineNumbers"><pre>1

<span class="ot">container</span>.<span class="fu">appendChild</span>(list);</code></pre></td></tr></table>
<p>Next we can iterate through the plays, creating an individual list item <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> for each one. For now, we’ll just insert the date and title as text.</p>
<table class="sourceCode javascript numberLines"><tr class="sourceCode"><td class="lineNumbers"><pre>1

    <span class="ot">list</span>.<span class="fu">appendChild</span>(listItem);
})</code></pre></td></tr></table>
<p>Here’s a truncated version of the resulting list. It may not look like much (yet), but it has the essential data and structure.</p>

    <span class="kw">&lt;li&gt;</span>1590-1594: The Taming of the Shrew<span class="kw">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
    <span class="kw">&lt;li&gt;</span>1590-1591: Henry VI, Part 2<span class="kw">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
    <span class="kw">&lt;li&gt;</span>1591: Henry VI, Part 3<span class="kw">&lt;/li&gt;</span>

<span class="kw">&lt;/ol&gt;</span></code></pre></td></tr></table>
<p>In the spirit of semantic <span class="smcp">HTML</span>, we should stop and consider if that markup can be improved. Since it appears first in our list items, let’s consider the date or date range for a play. Although there has been some controversy around the decision, <span class="smcp">HTML5</span> has defined support for a <code>&lt;time&gt;</code> element to contain dates and times. Using that element as a wrapper will make our dates more semantic. The second part of each list item is the title of the play. As it happens, <span class="smcp">HTML5</span>’s <code>&lt;cite&gt;</code> element is perfect for that content. To quote the <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/text-level-semantics.html#the-cite-element">current standard</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The cite element represents the title of a work (e.g. a book, […] <strong>a play,</strong> […] etc). This can be a work that is being quoted or referenced in detail (i.e. a citation), or it can just be a work that is mentioned in passing. [Emphasis added.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To add those elements to our code, we’ll have to distinguish between dates that are single years and those that are ranges. Looking for a dash <code>-</code> in the data will tell us which we have. Notice how we handle date ranges in lines 4 through 10. Since a range has a start and end time, we create two distinct <code>&lt;time&gt;</code> elements. We don’t need to add any punctuation between the dates at this point.</p>

<h3 id="step-4-include-the-supporting-content">Step 4: Include the Supporting Content</h3>
<p>When we created a time line using the Chronoline.js library, we weren’t able to include the supporting content from Wikipedia because the library did not offer that option. In this example, though, we have complete control over the content, so let’s include that information in our time line. For most plays our data includes its first official record, its first publication, its first performance, and a discussion of the evidence. This type of content is perfectly matched to the <span class="smcp">HTML</span> <em>description list</em> <code>&lt;dl&gt;</code> so that’s how we’ll add it to our page. It can follow the <code>&lt;cite&gt;</code> of the play’s title.</p>

<p>We can define a mapping array to help add the individual terms to each play. That array maps the property name in our data set to the label we want to use in the content.</p>

<p>With that array we can quickly add the descriptions to our content. We iterate over the array using <code>.forEach()</code>. At each iteration we make sure that the data has content (line 6) before creating the description item. A description item contains the term(s) being described in one <code>&lt;dt&gt;</code> tag and the description itself in a <code>&lt;dd&gt;</code> tag.</p>

<h3 id="step-5-optionally-take-advantage-of-jquery">Step 5: Optionally Take Advantage of jQuery</h3>
<p>Our code so far has used nothing but plain JavaScript. If you’re using jQuery on your web pages, you can shorten the code a bit by taking advantage of some jQuery features. If your web pages aren’t using jQuery already, the minor enhancements in this step don’t justify adding it, but if you’d like to see a more concise version, check out the book’s source code for an alternative.</p>
<h3 id="step-6-fix-time-line-problems-with-css">Step 6: Fix Time Line Problems with CSS</h3>
<p>Now that we’ve built our time line’s content in <span class="smcp">HTML</span>, it’s time to define the styles that determine its appearance. Throughout this example we’ll focus on the functional aspects of styling rather than pure visual elements such as fonts and colors, since you’ll probably want those visual styles to be specific to your own web site.</p>
<p>The first step is a simple one. We want to get rid of the numbering (1, 2, 3, …) that browsers normally add to ordered list items. A single rule banishes them from our time line. By setting the <code>list-style-type</code> to <code>none</code> we tell the browser not to add any special characters to our list items.</p>
<table class="sourceCode css numberLines"><tr class="sourceCode"><td class="lineNumbers"><pre>1
2
3
</pre></td><td class="sourceCode"><pre><code class="sourceCode css"><span class="fl">.timeline</span> li <span class="kw">{</span>
    <span class="kw">list-style-type:</span> <span class="dt">none</span><span class="kw">;</span>
<span class="kw">}</span></code></pre></td></tr></table>
<p>We can also use CSS rules to add some punctuation to our semantic HTML. First we look for places where two <code>&lt;time&gt;</code> elements appear right after each other, while skipping isolated <code>&lt;time&gt;</code> tags. The trick to finding <code>&lt;time&gt;</code> pairs is the CSS adjacent selector <code>+</code>. A rule with <code>time + time</code> specifies a <code>&lt;time&gt;</code> element that immediately follows a <code>&lt;time&gt;</code> element. To add the punctuation, we use the <code>:before</code> pseudo-selector to specify what we want to happen <em>before</em> this second <code>&lt;time&gt;</code> tag, and we set the <code>content</code> property to indicate the content we want inserted.</p>
<table class="sourceCode css numberLines"><tr class="sourceCode"><td class="lineNumbers"><pre>1
2
3
</pre></td><td class="sourceCode"><pre><code class="sourceCode css"><span class="fl">.timeline</span> li &gt; time + time<span class="dv">:before</span> <span class="kw">{</span>
    <span class="kw">content:</span> <span class="st">&quot;-&quot;</span><span class="kw">;</span>
<span class="kw">}</span></code></pre></td></tr></table>
<p>If you haven’t seen the <code>&gt;</code> before in a CSS rule, it’s the direct descendant selector. In this example, it means that the <code>&lt;time&gt;</code> element must be an immediate child of the <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> element. We’re using this selector so our rules won’t inadvertently apply to other <code>&lt;time&gt;</code> elements that may be nested deeper within the list item’s content.</p>
<p>To finish up the punctuation, let’s add a colon and space after the last of the <code>&lt;time&gt;</code> elements in each list item. We have to use two pseudo-selectors for this rule. The <code>:last-of-type</code> selector will target the last <code>&lt;time&gt;</code> element in the list item. That’s the first <code>&lt;time&gt;</code> if there’s only one and the second <code>&lt;time&gt;</code> if both are present. Then we add the <code>:after</code> pseudo-selector to insert content after that <code>&lt;time&gt;</code> element.</p>
<table class="sourceCode css numberLines"><tr class="sourceCode"><td class="lineNumbers"><pre>1

    <span class="kw">content:</span> <span class="st">&quot;: &quot;</span><span class="kw">;</span>

<p>Now we can add a little flair to the visualization.</p>
<h3 id="step-7-add-styles-to-visually-structure-the-time-line">Step 7: Add Styles to Visually Structure the Time Line</h3>
<p>The next set of CSS styles will improve the visual structure of the time line. First among those improvements will be making the time line look more like, well, a <em>line.</em> To do that we can add a border to the left side of the <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> elements. When we do that, we’ll also want to make sure that those <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> elements don’t have any margins, as margins would introduce gaps in the border and break the continuity of the line.</p>
<table class="sourceCode css numberLines"><tr class="sourceCode"><td class="lineNumbers"><pre>1

7
</pre></td><td class="sourceCode"><pre><code class="sourceCode css"><span class="fl">.timeline</span> li <span class="kw">{</span>
    <span class="kw">border-left:</span> <span class="dt">2px</span> <span class="dt">solid</span> <span class="dt">black</span><span class="kw">;</span>
<span class="kw">}</span>
<span class="fl">.timeline</span> dl,
<span class="fl">.timeline</span> li <span class="kw">{</span>
    <span class="kw">margin:</span> <span class="dt">0</span><span class="kw">;</span>
<span class="kw">}</span></code></pre></td></tr></table>
<p>These styles add a nice vertical line on the left side of our entire time line. Now that we have that line, we can shift the dates over to the left side of it. The shift requires rules for the parent <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> as well as the <code>&lt;time&gt;</code> elements. For the parent <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> elements we want their <code>position</code> specified as <code>relative</code>.</p>
<table class="sourceCode css numberLines"><tr class="sourceCode"><td class="lineNumbers"><pre>1

</pre></td><td class="sourceCode"><pre><code class="sourceCode css"><span class="fl">.timeline</span> li <span class="kw">{</span>
    <span class="kw">position:</span> <span class="dt">relative</span><span class="kw">;</span>
<span class="kw">}</span></code></pre></td></tr></table>
<p>By itself, this rule doesn’t actually change our time line. It does, however, establish a <em>positioning context</em> for any elements that are children of the <code>&lt;li&gt;</code>. Those children include the <code>&lt;time&gt;</code> elements that we want to move. With the <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> set to <code>position: relative</code> we can now set the <code>&lt;time&gt;</code> children to <code>position: absolute</code>. This rule lets us specify exactly where the browser should place the time elements, <em>relative</em> to the parent <code>&lt;li&gt;</code>. We want to move all <code>&lt;time&gt;</code> elements to the left, and we want to move the second <code>&lt;time&gt;</code> element down. The first selector below will target both of our <code>&lt;time&gt;</code> tags while the second selector, using the same <code>time + time</code> trick described above, targets only the second of two <code>&lt;time&gt;</code> tags.</p>

    <span class="kw">left:</span> <span class="dt">-3.85em</span><span class="kw">;</span>
<span class="kw">}</span></code></pre></td></tr></table>
<p>Notice that we’re using <code>em</code> units rather than pixel <code>px</code> units for this shift. By using <code>em</code> units we define our shift to be relative to the current font size, regardless of what it is. That gives us the freedom to change the font size without having to go back and tweak any pixel positioning.</p>
<p>The specific values for the position shift may need adjustment depending on the specific font face, but, in general, we use a negative <code>left</code> position to shift content further to the left than it would normal appear, and a positive <code>top</code> position to move the content down the page.</p>
<p>After moving the dates to the left of the vertical line, we’ll also want to shift the main content a bit to the right so it doesn’t crowd up against the line. The <code>padding-left</code> property takes care of that. And while we’re adjusting the left padding we can also add a bit of padding on the bottom to separate each play from the other.</p>
<table class="sourceCode css numberLines"><tr class="sourceCode"><td class="lineNumbers"><pre>1

</pre></td><td class="sourceCode"><pre><code class="sourceCode css"><span class="fl">.timeline</span> li <span class="kw">{</span>

    <span class="kw">padding-bottom:</span> <span class="dt">1em</span><span class="kw">;</span>
<span class="kw">}</span></code></pre></td></tr></table>
<p>With the dates and the main content on opposite sides of our vertical line, there’s no longer any need for any punctuation after the date. We can, therefore, remove the style that adds a colon after the last <code>&lt;time&gt;</code> element.</p>
<style>
.strikeThrough td.sourceCode { text-decoration: line-through; }
</style>
<table class="sourceCode css numberLines strikeThrough"><tr class="sourceCode"><td class="lineNumbers"><pre>1

    <span class="kw">content:</span> <span class="st">&quot;: &quot;</span><span class="kw">;</span>
<span class="kw">}</span></code></pre></td></tr></table>
<p>The fact that we’re able to make this change highlights one of the reasons for using CSS to add the colon in the first place. If we had included the punctuation explicitly in the markup (by, for example, generating it in the JavaScript code), then our markup would be more tightly coupled to our styles. If a style modification changed whether or not the colon was appropriate, we would have to go back and change the JavaScript as well. With the approach that we’re using here, however, styles and markup are much more independent. Any style changes are isolated to our CSS rules; no modifications to the JavaScript are required.</p>
<p>As part of the improved visual styling we can make a few other changes to our time line. We can increase the font size for each play’s title to make that information more prominent. At the same time we can add some extra spacing below the title, and we can indent the description list a bit.</p>

<p>For a last bit of polish let’s add a bullet right on the vertical line to mark each plan and tie the title more closely to the dates. We use a large bullet (several times the normal size) and position it right over the line. As you can see from the rules below, the unicode character for a bullet can be represented as <code>&quot;\2022&quot;</code>. The exact position values will depend on the specific font, but a bit of trial and error can perfect the adjustments.</p>

<p>Now our time line is starting to look like an actual time <em>line.</em> In your own pages you could include additional styles to define fonts, colors, and so on, but even without those decorations the visualization is effective.</p>

<h3 id="step-8-add-interactivity">Step 8: Add Interactivity</h3>
<p>The full details on all 40 of Shakespeare’s plays might be a little overwhelming for a first view of our time line. The visualization would be more effective if it showed only the play titles at first, but let users reveal more details through interactions. Because we’re building this visualization ourselves, we have all the control necessary to make that happen.</p>
<p>First we’ll set up a few additional styles. There are several ways to hide the play details with CSS, the most obvious being the <code>display:none</code> property. As we’ll see a little later though, a better choice for our timeline is setting the <code>max-height</code> to 0. If the maximum height of an element is 0, then, in theory, it should be invisible. In practice we also have to set the <code>overflow</code> property to <code>hidden</code>. Otherwise, even though the <code>&lt;dl&gt;</code> element itself has no height, the browser will display the content that overflows from it. Since we want our description lists to start out hidden, we can set that property as the default.</p>
<table class="sourceCode css numberLines"><tr class="sourceCode"><td class="lineNumbers"><pre>1
2
3
4
</pre></td><td class="sourceCode"><pre><code class="sourceCode css"><span class="fl">.timeline</span> li dl <span class="kw">{</span>
    <span class="kw">max-height:</span> <span class="dt">0</span><span class="kw">;</span>
    <span class="kw">overflow:</span> <span class="dt">hidden</span><span class="kw">;</span>
<span class="kw">}</span></code></pre></td></tr></table>
<p>To reveal a play’s details, users click on the play’s title in the <code>&lt;cite&gt;</code> element. So that users know that they can click on the title, we’ll change the mouse cursor from the normal arrow to the “clickable” hand. We can also change the <code>display</code> property from the default <code>inline</code> to <code>block</code>. That change gives users a larger and more consistent area to click.</p>
<table class="sourceCode css numberLines"><tr class="sourceCode"><td class="lineNumbers"><pre>1

    <span class="kw">display:</span> <span class="dt">block</span><span class="kw">;</span>
<span class="kw">}</span></code></pre></td></tr></table>
<p>Finally, we need a way to reveal a play’s details. We’ll do that by adding a class of <code>&quot;expanded&quot;</code> to the <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> for the play. When that class is present, our styles should override the <code>max-height</code> of <code>0</code>.</p>
<table class="sourceCode css numberLines"><tr class="sourceCode"><td class="lineNumbers"><pre>1
2
3
</pre></td><td class="sourceCode"><pre><code class="sourceCode css"><span class="fl">.timeline</span> li<span class="fl">.expanded</span> dl <span class="kw">{</span>
    <span class="kw">max-height:</span> <span class="dt">40em</span><span class="kw">;</span>
<span class="kw">}</span></code></pre></td></tr></table>
<p>The exact value for the expanded <code>max-height</code> will depend on the content. In general, though, it should be large enough to reveal the full details for the item. It’s okay to make it a little larger than necessary “just in case.” Don’t go overboard, however, and make it unreasonably large. (We’ll see why at the end of this step.)</p>
<p>With these styles in place we can add a bit of JavaScript to control them. It won’t take much. The first step is writing an event handler that will be called when users click. That function will take a single parameter, specifically an <code>Event</code> object, with details about the click. One of those details is the <code>.target</code> property which will contain a reference to the specific element of the page on which the user clicked. We only care about clicks on the <code>&lt;cite&gt;</code> elements.</p>
<table class="sourceCode javascript numberLines"><tr class="sourceCode"><td class="lineNumbers"><pre>1

        <span class="co">// Code continues...</span>
    }
};</code></pre></td></tr></table>
<p>Once we know that a <code>&lt;cite&gt;</code> was clicked, we find the <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> element that is its parent. We can then check to see if the <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> has the <code>&quot;expanded&quot;</code> class. If not, we add it. If the class is already present, we remove it. Our approach is a bit primitive because it only allows one class to be defined for the <code>&lt;li&gt;</code>. That’s all we need for this example, though, so we’ll stick with it.</p>

        }
    }
};</code></pre></td></tr></table>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: modern browsers have a more sophisticated interface for controlling the class attributes of elements. That interface is the <code>classList</code>, and it easily supports multiple classes per element, as well as toggling the class on and off with a single function. Older browsers (namely Internet Explorer version 9 and earlier) don’t support that interface, however. Since we don’t need the extra functionality, the older <code>className</code> is sufficient for this example.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With our event handling function defined, we can associate it with clicks anywhere on the timeline. The standard <code>addEventListener</code> method creates the association for any element.</p>
<table class="sourceCode javascript numberLines"><tr class="sourceCode"><td class="lineNumbers"><pre>1
</pre></td><td class="sourceCode"><pre><code class="sourceCode javascript"><span class="ot">document</span>.<span class="fu">getElementById</span>(<span class="st">&quot;timeline&quot;</span>).<span class="fu">addEventListener</span>(<span class="st">&quot;click&quot;</span>, clicked);</code></pre></td></tr></table>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: You might be curious as to why we’re associating an event listener with the entire time line visualization instead of, for example, adding individual event listeners to each <code>&lt;cite&gt;</code>. That alternative would eliminate the need to check the event target in the handler; however, it turns out that it’s much less efficient than the approach we’re taking. Event listeners can consume a fair bit of JavaScript resources, and our page will perform better if we keep them to a minimum.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you’re using jQuery, the required code is even simpler:</p>
<table class="sourceCode javascript numberLines"><tr class="sourceCode"><td class="lineNumbers"><pre>1
2
3
</pre></td><td class="sourceCode"><pre><code class="sourceCode javascript"><span class="fu">$</span>(<span class="st">&quot;#timeline&quot;</span>).<span class="fu">on</span>(<span class="st">&quot;click&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;cite&quot;</span>, <span class="kw">function</span>() {
    <span class="fu">$</span>(<span class="kw">this</span>).<span class="fu">parent</span>(<span class="st">&quot;li&quot;</span>).<span class="fu">toggleClass</span>(<span class="st">&quot;expanded&quot;</span>);
})</code></pre></td></tr></table>
<p>We’re almost ready to show our new and improved time line to the world, but there’s one final refinement we can make. Our current version shows or hides a play’s details all at once. This transition can be abrupt to users as content appears or disappears instantly. We can provide a better experience by gracefully transitioning between the two states, and a natural transition for this time line is animating the height of the content. When the details are hidden, they have a height of 0. And when we want to show them, we will gradually animate the height to its natural value.</p>
<p>It’s possible to add these animations using JavaScript. The jQuery library, in fact, has a fairly extensive set of animation functions. In modern browsers, however, it is much better to animate content using CSS transitions. Web browsers are optimized for CSS, often offloading the computations to special high performance graphics co-processors. In those cases CSS-based animations can perform several orders of magnitude better than JavaScript. The only disadvantage to using CSS for animations is a lack of support in older browsers. But animation isn’t usually <em>critical</em> to most web pages. Sure it’s nice, but if a user with an older browser misses out on the graceful transitions, it isn’t the end of the world. The web page will still <em>function</em> just fine.</p>
<p>The CSS <code>transition</code> property is the simplest way to define a CSS animation. It specifies the actual property to animate, the duration of the animation, and the <em>easing function</em> to follow. Here’s a rule we could use in our example:</p>
<table class="sourceCode css numberLines"><tr class="sourceCode"><td class="lineNumbers"><pre>1
2
3
</pre></td><td class="sourceCode"><pre><code class="sourceCode css"><span class="fl">.timeline</span> li dl <span class="kw">{</span>
    <span class="kw">transition:</span> max-height <span class="dt">500ms</span> ease-in-out<span class="kw">;</span>
<span class="kw">}</span></code></pre></td></tr></table>
<p>This rule defines a transition for the time line’s <code>&lt;dl&gt;</code> elements. It specifies that the property to animate is <code>max-height</code>, so the transition will take effect whenever an element’s <code>max-height</code> property changes (and that’s precisely the property we modify when the <code>&quot;expanded&quot;</code> class is added or removed). The transition rule also specifies that the animation should take 500 ms, and that it should “ease in” and “ease out.” This last property indicates that the animation should start slowly; speed up, and then slow down again before finishing. That behavior usually looks more natural than animating at a constant speed.</p>
<p>CSS transitions can animate many CSS properties, but there is one important constraint. Both the starting and ending values must be explicit. That constraint explains why we’re animating <code>max-height</code> instead of <code>height</code>, even though it’s really just <code>height</code> that we want to change. Unfortunately, we can’t animate <code>height</code> because its has no explicit value when the description list is expanded. Every <code>&lt;dl&gt;</code> will have its own height based on its content, and there’s no way we can predict those values in our CSS. The <code>max-height</code> property, on the other hand, gives us explicit values for both states—<code>0</code> and <code>40em</code> in this example—so CSS can animate its transitions. We just have to be sure that no <code>&lt;dl&gt;</code> has content more than <code>40em</code> high. Otherwise the extra content will be cut off. This doesn’t mean, however, that we should set the <code>max-height</code> for expanded <code>&lt;dl&gt;</code> elements to an astronomical value. To see why, consider what would happen if we transitioned <code>max-height</code> to <code>1000em</code> for a <code>&lt;dl&gt;</code> that only needed <code>10em</code> of height. Ignoring (for simplicity) the complications of easing, it would only take 1/100<sup>th</sup> of the full transition time before the full content of the element was visible. The animation that we had planned to take 500 ms is over in 5 ms instead.</p>
<p>There is one final complication with CSS transitions. Most browsers implemented the functionality before the official standard was finalized. To make sure their implementations wouldn’t conflict with potential changes in the official standards, browser vendors initially implemented transitions using a proprietary syntax. That syntax adds a prefix (<code>-webkit-</code> for Safari and Chrome, <code>-moz-</code> for FireFox, and <code>-o-</code> for Opera) to the property name. To cover all the major browsers, we must include a rule with each prefix.</p>

Additionally, Stanley Wells argues that the scenes involving more than four characters, \"betray an uncertainty of technique suggestive of inexperience.\" As such, the play is considered to be one of the first Shakespeare composed upon arriving in London (Roger Warren, following E.A.J. Honigmann, suggests he may have written it prior to his arrival) and, as such, he lacked theatrical experience. This places the date of composition as most likely somewhere between 1589 and 1591, by which time it is known he was working on the Henry VI plays" },

This could have been either the 1594 A Shrew or the Shakespearean The Shrew, but as the Admiral's Men and the Lord Chamberlain's Men were sharing the theatre at the time, and as such Shakespeare himself would have been there, scholars tend to assume that it was The Shrew. The Shakespearean version was definitely performed at court before King Charles I and Queen Henrietta Maria on 26 November 1633, where it was described as being \"liked'.", "evidence": "Kier Elam posits a date of 1591 as a terminus post quem for the composition of The Shrew, based on Shakespeare's probable use of two sources published that year; Abraham Ortelius's map of Italy in the Theatrum Orbis Terrarum (4th ed.) and John Florio's Second Fruits. However, scholars continue to debate the relationship between the 1594 A Shrew and the 1623 The Shrew. Some theorise that A Shrew is a reported text, meaning The Shrew must have been written prior to 2 May 1594; others, that A Shrew is an early draft, meaning The Shrew must have been completed sometime after 2 May 1594. There are also arguments that A Shrew may have been a source for The Shrew, that they could be two completely unrelated plays based on the same (now lost) source (the \"Ur-Shrew\" theory), or A Shrew could be an adaptation of The Shrew. Critics remain divided on this issue, and as such, dating the play is extremely difficult." },

Benson directed a production at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre.", "evidence": "It is known that the play was definitely on stage by early 1592 as in A Groatsworth of Wit, Bought with a Million of Repentance, Robert Greene mocked Shakespeare by parodying a line from 3 Henry VI. Groatsworth was registered in the Stationers' Register in September 1592, meaning True Tragedy/3 Henry VI must have been on stage prior to 23 June 1592 as that was when the government shut the London theatres due to an outbreak of plague. To have been on stage by June 1592, the play was most likely written some time in 1591." },

In August, Thomas Nashe published Piers Penniless his Supplication to the Devil, in which he refers to a play he had recently seen featuring a rousing depiction of Lord Talbot, a major character in 1 Henry VI. Most critics take Nashe's reference to Talbot as proof that the play Henslowe saw was 1 Henry VI. As such, to have been a new play in March 1592, it was most likely written some time in 1591. Furthermore, many critics consider 1 Henry VI to have been written as a prequel to the successful two-part play, The Contention and True Tragedy. Possibly co-written with Thomas Nashe and/or other unidentified dramatists." },

As such, the play must have been composed some time prior to September. Additionally, it is unlikely to have been written later than June 1592, as that was when the London theatres were closed due to an outbreak of plague. The theatres would remain shut for the better part of two years, not fully reopening until March 1594 and Shakespeare concentrated most of his energies during this period on poetry. As such, the play was most likely composed sometime between late-1591 and early 1592. Possibly co-written with George Peele" },

The Folio text appears under the title The Tragedy of Richard the Third, with the Landing of Earle Richmond, and the Battell at Bosworth Field.", "performance": "The play was performed extensively in Shakespeare's lifetime; it is mentioned in Palladis Tamia in 1598 (as \"Richard the 3.'), and by the time of the First Folio in 1623, had been published in quarto six times (1597, 1598, 1603, 1605, 1612 and 1622), and referenced by multiple writers of the day. Regarding specific performances however, there is little solid evidence. In 1602, John Manningham mentions seeing Richard Burbage playing the role of Richard III, but he offers no further information. The earliest definite performance was at St James's Palace on 16 or 17 November 1633 by the King's Men.", "evidence": "It is known that Richard III was definitely a sequel to 3 Henry VI, which was on-stage by 23 June 1592, hence Richard III must have been written later than early 1592. Additionally, it has been argued that the play contains evidence suggesting it was originally written for Strange's Men, but then rewritten for Pembroke's Men, a company which formed in mid-1592. Also, with the closure of the theatres due to an outbreak of plague in June 1592, the play was unlikely to have been written any later than that, all of which suggests a date of composition as sometime in early-1592." },

However, this production presented only the first half of the play (dealing with the King's infatuation with the Countess of Salisbury). Performed under the title, The King and the Countess, it was presented in a single matinée performance with the anonymous sixteenth century liturgical drama, Jacob and Esau. The first known performance of the complete text took place in June 1987, at the Theatr Clwyd, directed by Toby Robertson.", "evidence": "Obviously, the play was written by December 1595. According to the title page of the quarto, it had been performed recently in London, but no company information is provided. This could mean that the company that performed the play had disbanded during the closure of the theatres from June 1592 to March 1594. Furthermore, internal evidence suggests that the play may have been specifically written for Pembroke's Men, who ceased performing in September 1593. This places the date of composition as most likely somewhere between early 1592 and September 1593." },
  { "play": "The Comedy of Errors",            "date": "1594",      "record": "Francis Meres' Palladis Tamia (1598); referred to as \"Errors\"", "published": "First Folio (1623)", "performance": "probably on Innocents Day, 28 December 1594 at Gray's Inn (one of the four London Inns of Court). The only known evidence for this performance is the Gesta Grayorum, a 1688 text printed for William Canning based on a manuscript apparently handed down from the 1590s, detailing the \"Prince of Purpoole\" festival from December 1594 to February 1595.[c] According to the text, after a disastrous attempt to stage \"some notable performance [...] it was thought good not to offer any thing of Account, saving Dancing and Revelling with Gentlewomen; and after such Sports, a Comedy of Errors (like to Plautus his Menaechmus) was played by the Players. So that Night was begun, and continued to the end, in nothing but Confusion and Errors; whereupon, it was ever afterwards called, The Night of Errors.\" As Comedy of Errors is indeed based on Menaechmus, this is almost universally accepted as a reference to an otherwise unrecorded performance of the play, probably by Shakespeare's own company, the newly formed Lord Chamberlain's Men.", "evidence": "traditionally, the play has been dated quite early (Ros King, for example, dates it 1586-1589), and has often been seen as Shakespeare's first comedy, perhaps his first play. However, stylistic and linguistic analysis (proportion of verse to prose, amount of rhyme, use of colloquialism in verse, and a rare word test) has placed it closer to the composition of Richard II and Romeo and Juliet, both of which were written in 1594 or 1595. More specifically, the limited setting (it is one of only two Shakespeare plays to observe the Classical unities) and the brevity of the play (Shakespeare's shortest at 1777 lines), along with the great abundance of legal terminology, suggests to some critics the probability of it being written especially for the Gray's Inn performance, which would place its composition in the latter half of 1594. If it was written for Gray's Inn, it most likely represents the first play by Shakespeare which was specifically commissioned. In this case, that commission could have come from Henry Wriothesley, Earl of Southampton, a member of the Inns of Court, and Shakespeare's patron." },
  { "play": "Love's Labour's Lost",            "date": "1594-1595", "record": "a version of the play was published in quarto in 1598, although the exact date is unknown as it was never entered into the Stationers' Register. Also in 1598, Robert Tofte mentioned the play in his sonnet sequence Alba. The months minde of a melancholy lover; \"Love's Labour Lost, I once did see, a play/Y'cleped so, so called to my pain.\" The date of publication of Alba is unknown as it also was not entered into the Register. Additionally, the play is mentioned in Meres' Palladis Tamia (registered on 7 September, with a dedication dated 10 October). It is unknown exactly which one of these three constitutes the first official record of the play.", "published": "version of the play published in quarto in 1598 as A Pleasant Conceited Comedie called Loves labors lost (the first known printing of a Shakespearean play to include his name on the title page). The Folio text appears under the title Love's Labour's lost.", "performance": "according to the quarto title page, the play was performed at court for Queen Elizabeth sometime over Christmas 1597, however, no further information is provided. The earliest definite performance took place some time between 8 and 15 January 1605, for Anne of Denmark, at either Henry Wriothesley or Robert Cecil's house.", "evidence": "Obviously, the play was written by Christmas 1597, but narrowing the date further has proved difficult, with most efforts focusing upon stylistic evidence. Traditionally, it was seen as one of Shakespeare's earliest plays (Charles Gildon wrote in 1710; \"since it is one of the worst of Shakespeare's Plays, nay I think I may say the very worst, I cannot but think it is his first.') For much of the eighteenth century, it tended to be dated 1590, until Malone's newly constructed chronology in 1778, which dated it 1594. In his 1930 chronology, E.K. Chambers found the play to be more sophisticated than Malone had allowed for, and dated it 1595. Today most scholars tend to concur with a date of 1594-1595, and the play is often grouped with the \"lyrical plays'; Richard II, Romeo and Juliet and A Midsummer Night's Dream, because of its prolific use of rhyming. These four plays are argued to represent a phase of Shakespeare's career where he was experimenting with rhyming iambic pentameter as an alternative form to standard blank verse; Richard II has more rhymed verse than any other history play (19.1%), Romeo and Juliet more than any other tragedy (16.6%) and Love's Labour's and Midsummer Night more than any other comedy (43.1% and 45.5% respectively). All four tend to be dated to 1594/1595. In support of this, Ants Oras' pause test places the play after Richard III, which is usually dated 1592. Furthermore, Taylor finds possible allusions to the Gray's Inn revels of December 1594 (specifically the Muscovite masque in Act 5, Scene 2), and also finds plausible Geoffrey Bullough's argument that the satire of the King of Navarre (loosely based on Henry of Navarre, who was associated with oath breaking after abjuring Protestantism in 1593) favours a date after December 1594, when Henry survived an assassination attempt." },
  { "play": "Love's Labour's Won",             "date": "1595-1596", "record": "Francis Meres' Palladis Tamia (1598); referred to as \"Love labours wonne\"", "published": "published in quarto some time prior to 1603", "performance": "there are no recorded performances of the play", "evidence": "There are only two known references to this play. One is in Meres' Palladis Tamia, the other is on a list by Christopher Hunt, dated August 1603, which gives a list of published plays sold by an Exeter bookseller. Up until 1953, only Meres' reference was known, until Hunt's two pages of handwriting were discovered in the backing of a copy of Thomas Gataker's Certaine Sermones. The discovery was handed over to T.W. Baldwin, who published his findings in 1957 as Shakespeare's Love's Labour's Won. The title suggests the play was written as a sequel to Love's Labour's Lost, which is partially supported by the unusually open-ended nature of that play, hence Love's Labour's Won's position in the Oxford chronology. However, whether the play ever existed has been debated, with some critics speculating that it is simply another name for one of Shakespeare's known plays, a situation similar to Henry VIII, which was originally performed with the title All is True. As Meres refers to The Two Gentlemen of Verona, The Comedy of Errors and The Merchant of Venice, prior to the discovery of the Hunt reference, a common suggestion was The Taming of the Shrew, but as Hunt mentions this play, it could not be Love's Labour's Won. Although Much Ado About Nothing, All's Well That Ends Well and Troilus and Cressida have also been cited as possibilities, these plays tend to be dated later than 1598 (much later in the case of Troilus, although the argument is that Love's Labour's Won is an early draft), and as there are no other pre-1598 Shakespearean comedies with which to equate it, it seems certain that the play did exist, that it was performed and published, but that it has since been lost." },
  { "play": "Richard II",                      "date": "1595",      "record": "entered into the Stationers' Register on 29 August 1597 as \"the Tragedye of Richard the Second'.", "published": "version of the play published in quarto in 1597 as The Tragedie of King Richard the second (republished in 1598 (twice), 1608 and 1615). The Folio text appears under the title The life and death of King Richard the Second", "performance": "possible performance on 9 December 1595 at Sir Edward Hoby's house. Hoby's wife, the daughter of Baron Hunsdon (chief patron of the Lord Chamberlain's Men), wrote a letter to Sir Robert Cecil inviting him to supper and to see \"K. Richard present him self to your vewe.\" Many scholars see this as a reference to Richard II, especially because of the Hunsdon connection with Shakespeare's company. However, some scholars argue that the reference could be to a painting, not a play, whilst others argue there is no evidence that \"K. Richard\" necessarily refers to Richard II, suggesting it could refer to Richard III or to another play entirely. There is no complete consensus on this issue, although most scholars do tend to favour the Richard II theory. The earliest definite performance was at the Globe Theatre on 7 February 1601, organised by the Earl of Essex in a performance probably intended to inspire his supporters on the eve of his armed rebellion against Queen Elizabeth. According to testimony given by actor Augustine Phillips at Essex' trial for treason, he paid the Lord Chamberlain's Men forty shillings more than the standard rate to stage the play.", "evidence": "Richard II is usually seen as one of the \"lyrical plays', along with Love's Labour's Lost, Romeo and Juliet and A Midsummer Night's Dream; four plays in which Shakespeare used rhymed iambic pentameter more than anywhere else in his career. The four plays also include elaborate punning, rhetorical patterning, a general avoidance of colloquialisms and a high volume of metrical regularity. All four of these plays tend to be dated to 1594-1595. Also important in dating the play is Samuel Daniel's The First Four Books of the Civil Wars, which was entered into the Stationers' Register on 11 October 1594, and published in early 1595. Although some scholars have suggested that Daniel used Shakespeare as a source, which would mean the play was written somewhat earlier than 1594, most agree that Shakespeare used Daniel, especially in some of the later scenes, meaning the play could not have been written earlier than 1595." },

In addition, Salarino's reference to \"my wealthy Andrew docked in sand\" is thought to refer to the San Andréas, a Spanish merchant vessel that ran aground in Essex in June 1596.

Furthermore, evidence in the quarto text suggests that Shakespeare originally wrote the role of Dogberry for William Kempe, however, records indicate that Kempe left the Lord Chamberlain's Men sometime in late 1598, so the play must have been written before then.

The first definite dated performance took place on a ship anchored off the coast of Africa in September 1607, the Red Dragon. The play was performed by the crew.", "evidence": "Because the versions of Hamlet which appeared in 1603, in 1604 (again in quarto) and in the First Folio of 1623 differ so much from one another, dating the play is exceptionally difficult. There is also the problem of the Ur-Hamlet, a possible source used by Shakespeare, now lost. Others however, feel that Ur-Hamlet (if it ever existed) was most likely an early draft. Hamlet was written sometime between September 1598 (as it was not included in Meres' Palladis Tamia) and July 1602 (when it was registered in the Stationers Register). Furthermore, internal references to Julius Caesar would indicate the play could not have been written any earlier than September 1599. Additionally, in his 1598 copy of an edition of Geoffrey Chaucer's works, Gabriel Harvey has written that Shakespeare's \"Lucrece & his tragedie of Hamlet, prince of Denmarke, have it in them, to please the wiser sort'. Harvey also mentions the Earl of Essex as still alive, which would suggest he wrote the note prior to 25 February 1601, when Essex was executed. This would seem to narrow the date of composition to between September 1599 and February 1601; however, not all scholars accept the veracity of Harvey's note. Internal evidence in the play has also been cited, usually as illustrative of a date of composition of 1600 or 1601. As such, many scholars interpret the available evidence as suggestive of a date of initial composition sometime in 1600, with subsequent revisions. This dating, however, is far from universally accepted." },

A further possible source for the play has evoked some disagreement however. Whilst many scholars feel that Shakespeare used the anonymous play The True Chronicle History of King Leir (entered into the Stationers' Register on 8 May 1605), and hence must have been written between May 1605 and December 1606, others argue that the relationship between the two plays has been inverted, and The True Chronicle History of King Leir was actually written to capitalise on the success of Shakespeare's play, which was probably written in 1603 or 1604. No real critical consensus has been reached regarding this disagreement." },

There is no reference to the play whatsoever prior to 1623, and as such, evidence for its date of composition must come from within the play itself. Taylor concludes that Middleton and Shakespeare were jointly responsible for the play and assigns the composition date to 1605 on the basis of previous analyses of colloquialism-in-verse and rare vocabulary." },

However, there is considerable debate amongst scholars as to whether Forman's account is genuine", "published": "First Folio (1623) as The Tragedie of Macbeth", "performance": "possibly in April 1611, recorded by Simon Forman", "evidence": "Scholars place the date of composition as somewhere between 1603 and 1607, but efforts to narrow that date have proved inconclusive. Several possible topical references to the Gunpowder Plot of 1605 have been proposed and debated among scholars, but these references have not been universally accepted. In 1790, Edward Malone dated the play to 1606, and the vast majority of critics agree with this date even while acknowledging that little conclusive evidence exists, though the date seems correct in the context of Shakespeare's other work of the period. One suggested allusion supporting a date in late 1606 is the first witch's dialogue about a sailor's wife: \"'Aroint thee, witch!\" the rump-fed ronyon cries./Her husband's to Aleppo gone, master o' the Tiger\" (1.6-7). This has been thought to allude to the Tiger, a ship that returned to England 27 June 1606 after a disastrous voyage in which many of the crew were killed by pirates. A few lines later the witch speaks of the sailor, \"He shall live a man forbid:/Weary se'nnights nine times nine\" (1.21-2). The real ship was at sea 567 days, the product of 7x9x9, which has been taken as a confirmation of the allusion, which if correct, confirms that the play could not have been written any earlier than July 1606. A. R. Braunmuller, however, in the New Cambridge edition, finds the 1605-6 arguments inconclusive, and argues only for an earliest date of 1603. Further complicating the dating of Macbeth is the fact that the play shows evidence of later revisions by Middleton, particularly in the witch scenes." },

It first appears together with Shakespeare's other plays in the second issue of the Third Folio of 1664. In a contested field, the most widely accepted theory today is that Shakespeare collaborated on the play with another playwright, probably his younger colleague, George Wilkins. There is no complete agreement what the motives or mechanism of this collaboration were. In 1608, Wilkins published a prose narrative of Pericles purporting to be a narrative version of the play and which contains numerous phrases that seem to recall specific lines in the play, suggesting that work on the play preceded his composition of the prose version. Textual analysis of the play has suggested it be placed as in some close relation with All's Well That Ends Well and Coriolanus, which would confirm a date of 1607-1608." },

Shakespeare's treatment of the grain riots is strikingly reminiscent of the Midlands corn riots of 1607. Though Menenius' fable of the belly was used in other contemporary works, the wording of Menenius's speech about the body politic is derived from William Camden's Remaines (1605). Two possible echoes of George Chapman's Iliad (registered 14 November 1608) support a date of 1608-9. A reference to \"the coal of fire upon ice\" (1.1.170) is a possible allusion to the winter of 1607-08, when the frost was so severe that vendors set up booths on the frozen Thames river and pans of coals were placed on the ice so that pedestrians could warm themselves. An allusion to the complaints about Hugh Myddelton's project to bring water to London has also been detected in Martius' warning to the patricians (3.1.98-9). Taylor says that the cumulative internal evidence all points to a composition date of no earlier than spring of 1608, while others favour late 1608 to early 1609. Several allusions in other works establish a terminal date of composition: Ben Jonson's Epicœne, or The silent woman, composed in late 1609, mocks a peculiar phrase in the play, and Phantasma (registered 6 February 1609), written by Robert Armin, a member of the King's Men from 1599 to 1610, contains a close literary parallel. Critics also suggest that the regular act intervals indicate that it could have been written for the indoor Blackfriars Theatre, which Shakespeare's company acquired in 1608." },

<h2 id="using-a-web-component">Using a Web Component</h2>
<p>In this example, we’re going to look at another alternative approach; instead of building a time line from scratch using low level JavaScript, we’ll integrate a full-featured time line component: <a href="http://timeline.knightlab.com">Timeline <span class="smcp">JS</span></a>. In many ways this approach is the exact opposite of low level JavaScript. At its most basic, it requires no coding at all, as it can be as easy as embedding a YouTube video in a blog post. That method sacrifices a lot of control over the resulting visualization, however, so we’ll also look at ways to regain some of that control.</p>
<h3 id="step-1-preview-the-standard-component">Step 1: Preview the Standard Component</h3>
<p>Before spending too much time customizing the visualization, it’s worthwhile to check out the component in its most basic form. Fortunately Timeline <span class="smcp">JS</span> makes this process very simple. The <a href="http://timeline.knightlab.com">web site</a> will walk you through the steps in detail, but in a nutshell, they are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Create a <a href="http://docs.google.com">Google Docs</a> spreadsheet with data for the timeline.</li>
<li>Publish that spreadsheet for web access which creates a <span class="smcp">URL</span> for it.</li>
<li>Enter that <span class="smcp">URL</span> into a form on the Timeline <span class="smcp">JS</span> web site and it will generate an <span class="smcp">HTML</span> snippet.</li>
<li>Copy and paste the snippet into your web page.</li>
</ol>
<p>Figure <span class="nextfigure"/> shows what the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0An4ME25ELRdYdDk4WmRacmxjaDM0V0tDTk9vMnQxU1E#gid=0">spreadsheet</a> looks like for Shakespeare’s plays:</p>

<p>If the result meets the needs of your visualization, you may not have to go any further. Many web pages that use Timeline <span class="smcp">JS</span> do so in exactly this manner. There are some potential problems with the simplest approach, however:</p>
<ul>
<li>The data for the visualization must be available in a public Google Docs spreadsheet, so the approach may not be appropriate for confidential data.</li>
<li>The data source is a spreadsheet, so it may be difficult to update it often or show more real-time events. This problem doesn’t really affect our Shakespeare chronology, but if the time line you’re creating shows real time data such as trending topics on a social network, a static spreadsheet won’t be practical.</li>
<li>The embedded component has few styling options. Although the default styles and options that Timeline <span class="smcp">JS</span> offers are quite attractive, they are very limited and may not be appropriate for your web page.</li>
<li>The timeline is embedded as an <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code>, which gives Timeline <span class="smcp">JS</span> complete control over what is displayed in that section of your page. There is <strong>absolutely no indication</strong> that the organizations supporting Timeline <span class="smcp">JS</span> would do so, but, <em>in theory</em>, they could alter the content (for example by including ads) in ways that your site might not find appropriate.</li>
</ul>
<p>Fortunately, none of these possible concerns need prevent us from adding beautiful Timeline <span class="smcp">JS</span> visualizations to our web pages. The folks behind Timeline <span class="smcp">JS</span> make all of the software available as open source, giving us the flexibility to address all of the issues listed above. We’ll see how in the rest of this example.</p>
<h3 id="step-2-include-the-required-components">Step 2: Include the Required Components</h3>
<p>To use Timeline <span class="smcp">JS</span>, our web pages must include <span class="smcp">CSS</span> style sheets and JavaScript code. For now we’ll stick with the default styles, so we only need a single additional style sheet. The main JavaScript is contained in <code>timeline.js</code>.</p>
<p>It’s not obvious, but Timeline <span class="smcp">JS</span> also requires jQuery. When you embed a Timeline <span class="smcp">JS</span> <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> your main web page doesn’t have to include jQuery because the <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> will include it. To integrate the time line directly in our page, though, we have to include jQuery explicitly. We can, however, use a content distribution network instead of hosting it ourselves.</p>

<p>As you can see, we’ve added genre information to the plays, as well as optional multimedia links, and text for credits and captions. With that starting point, we can rearrange the data to match what Timeline <span class="smcp">JS</span> expects. The basic structure of that object, shown below, includes some overall properties (such as the headline), and an array of events. We can initialize it to an empty array.</p>
<table class="sourceCode javascript numberLines"><tr class="sourceCode"><td class="lineNumbers"><pre>1

};</code></pre></td></tr></table>
<p>Note that the <code>type</code> property is required and should be set to <code>&quot;default&quot;</code>.</p>
<p>Now we iterate through the data set adding events to <code>timelineData</code>. For the code below we’ll use <code>forEach</code> for this iteration, but there are plenty of alternatives we could use here (including <code>for</code> loops, array <code>.map()</code> methods, or jQuery’s <code>$.each()</code> and <code>$.map()</code> functions). The first step in each iteration is parsing the date information. It can take one of two forms, either a single year (<code>&quot;1591&quot;</code>) or a range of years (<code>&quot;1589-1591&quot;</code>). Our code assumes a single date and makes adjustments if it finds two.</p>

<h3 id="step-4-create-a-default-time-line">Step 4: Create a Default Time Line</h3>
<p>With our <span class="smcp">HTML</span> set up and our data set prepared, we can now call Timeline <span class="smcp">JS</span> to create its default visualization. Figuring out exactly how to do that, however, isn’t quite as simple as looking in the documentation. That’s because Timeline <span class="smcp">JS</span> assumes that it will be used primarily as an embedded and isolated component rather than an integrated part of a page. The documentation, therefore, describes how to use Timeline <span class="smcp">JS</span> using the <code>storyjs_embed.js</code> wrapper for embedded content. That wrapper loads all the Timeline <span class="smcp">JS</span> resources (style sheets, JavaScript, fonts, and so on) and if we use it as intended, we’ll end up with most of the same problems as simply embedding an <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>Fortunately, it’s not too difficult to skip all the embedding and simply access the JavaScript code directly. It only requires three steps:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Set up the configuration object.</li>
<li>Create a Timeline <span class="smcp">JS</span> object.</li>
<li>Initialize the object using the configuration object.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here what these steps will look like in our JavaScript, with the details left out for now:</p>
<table class="sourceCode javascript numberLines"><tr class="sourceCode"><td class="lineNumbers"><pre>1
2
3
</pre></td><td class="sourceCode"><pre><code class="sourceCode javascript"><span class="kw">var</span> timelineConfig = {<span class="co">/* needs properties */</span>};
<span class="kw">var</span> timelinejs = <span class="kw">new</span> <span class="ot">VMM</span>.<span class="fu">Timeline</span>(<span class="co">/* needs parameters */</span>);
<span class="ot">timelinejs</span>.<span class="fu">init</span>(timelineConfig);</code></pre></td></tr></table>
<p>We still need to fill in the exact configuration object and the parameters for the <code>VMM.Timeline</code> constructor. The configuration object is documented in the <a href="https://github.com/NUKnightLab/TimelineJS#config-options">Timeline <span class="smcp">JS</span> source</a>. We must provide a <code>type</code> (equal to <code>&quot;timeline&quot;</code>), dimensions, the data source, and the <code>id</code> of the <span class="smcp">HTML</span> element into which the timeline should be placed. For example, we could use:</p>
<table class="sourceCode javascript numberLines"><tr class="sourceCode"><td class="lineNumbers"><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
</pre></td><td class="sourceCode"><pre><code class="sourceCode javascript"> <span class="kw">var</span> timelineConfig = {
        <span class="dt">type</span>:       <span class="st">&#39;timeline&#39;</span>,
        <span class="dt">width</span>:      <span class="st">&#39;100%&#39;</span>,
        <span class="dt">height</span>:     <span class="st">&#39;600&#39;</span>,
        <span class="dt">source</span>:     {<span class="dt">timeline</span>: timelineData},
        <span class="dt">embed_id</span>:   <span class="st">&#39;timeline&#39;</span>
};</code></pre></td></tr></table>
<p>We have to pass many of those same parameters to the constructor. In particular, we provide the container’s <code>id</code> and the dimensions.</p>
<table class="sourceCode javascript numberLines"><tr class="sourceCode"><td class="lineNumbers"><pre>1
</pre></td><td class="sourceCode"><pre><code class="sourceCode javascript"><span class="kw">var</span> timelinejs = <span class="kw">new</span> <span class="ot">VMM</span>.<span class="fu">Timeline</span>(<span class="st">&#39;timeline&#39;</span>,<span class="st">&#39;100%&#39;</span>,<span class="st">&#39;600px&#39;</span>);</code></pre></td></tr></table>
<p>Finally we have to build our <span class="smcp">HTML</span> markup with care. Timeline <span class="smcp">JS</span> styles its <span class="smcp">HTML</span> appropriately for an embedded <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code>, but those styles aren’t as compatible with a time line that’s integrated in the page. In particular, it positions the time line absolutely and sets its <code>z-index</code>. If we don’t compensate, the time line will float out of the flow of the page content, which is almost certainly not desirable. There are several ways to adjust for this issue, and we’ll use a simple one in this example. Instead of a single <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>, we use two nested <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> elements. The inner <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> will contain the time line, and the outer <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> establishes both a positioning context and size for the time line.</p>
<table class="sourceCode html numberLines"><tr class="sourceCode"><td class="lineNumbers"><pre>1
2
3
</pre></td><td class="sourceCode"><pre><code class="sourceCode html"><span class="kw">&lt;div</span><span class="ot"> style=</span><span class="st">&quot;position:relative;height:600px;&quot;</span><span class="kw">&gt;</span>
    <span class="kw">&lt;div</span><span class="ot"> id=</span><span class="st">&quot;timeline&quot;</span><span class="kw">&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</span>
<span class="kw">&lt;/div&gt;</span></code></pre></td></tr></table>
<p>Now when our JavaScript executes, it produces the integrated time line shown in figure <span class="nextfigure"/> with the default Timeline <span class="smcp">JS</span> styling.</p>
<figure>
<div style="position:relative;height:600px;margin-top:20px;">

<figcaption>
With a little extra work, we can embed a Timeline <span class="smcp">JS</span> timeline directly in the page without an &lt;iframe&gt;.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Before leaving this step it’s worth considering how we’ve reached this point. We’ve taken a complete web component with explicit instructions for its use, and we’ve ignored those instructions. Instead, we’ve only included part of the component (albeit a major part). Figuring out how to use an isolated part of a web component (in a way that it isn’t necessarily intended for) can involve some guessing and trial and error, and there is clearly some risk in this approach. Even if you manage to get it working okay now, a future update might invalidate your implementation. If you adopt this approach with your web site, it’s a good idea to test the implementation thoroughly and to take extra care with any updates.</p>
<h3 id="step-5-adjust-the-time-line-styles">Step 5: Adjust the Time Line Styles</h3>
<p>Now that we’ve addressed the issues that an <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> can cause, we can turn our attention to the time line’s appearance. The <code>timeline.css</code> stylesheet determines that appearance, and we have several alternatives for adjusting it.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Modify <code>timeline.css</code> directly.</strong> Although this approach might seem the most obvious, it’s probably not what we should do. If you look at the file, you’ll notice that it’s compressed <span class="smcp">CSS</span> that’s difficult to read and understand. Making the appropriate modifications will be challenging. Furthermore, if we later update to a new version of Timeline <span class="smcp">JS</span>, that new version may well have a new <code>timeline.css</code>, and we’d have to start all over again.</li>
<li><strong>Work with the source code.</strong> Timeline <span class="smcp">JS</span> authors its styles using the <a href="http://lesscss.org"><span class="smcp">LESS</span></a> <span class="smcp">CSS</span> preprocessor. If you’re comfortable using a <span class="smcp">CSS</span> preprocessor, you could modify the source and build your own custom version of <code>timeline.css</code>. <span class="lgcp">LESS</span> has support for variables and mixins that make it easier to accommodate updates in the future. There are many applications that compile <span class="smcp">LESS</span> into <span class="smcp">CSS</span>; Timeline <span class="smcp">JS</span> uses <a href="https://incident57.com/codekit/">CodeKit</a> (which is only available for Apple’s Mac <span class="smcp">OS</span> <span class="smcp">X</span>) and the source code includes all of the appropriate application settings.</li>
<li><strong>Supersede <code>timeline.css</code> styles.</strong> Instead of changing the Timeline <span class="smcp">JS</span> stylesheet, leave it <em>as is</em> and add custom styles with a higher priority than the default styles. This approach takes advantage of the <em>cascade</em> of Cascading Style Sheets.</li>
</ol>
<p>For this example we’ll use the third approach. We’ll identify the <code>timeline.css</code> styles that we want to change and add new rules to our stylesheet to take precedence over those styles. When <span class="smcp">CSS</span> finds that multiple, conflicting rules apply to an element, it resolves the conflict by considering the specificity of the rules and their order in the document. We can give our rules priority by making them more specific than the <code>timeline.css</code> rules or by making them equally specific but including them after <code>timeline.css</code>.</p>
<p>First we’ll tackle the fonts that Timeline <span class="smcp">JS</span> uses. There’s nothing wrong with the default or optional fonts, but they may not match the style of our web page. In addition, downloading extra fonts will slow the performance of the page. The quickest way to find the styles that affect fonts is to look at one of the optional font selections that Timeline <span class="smcp">JS</span> offers on its web site. For example, if you select the “Merriweather &amp; News Cycle” option, you’ll see that Timeline <span class="smcp">JS</span> adds an additional style sheet to the visualization. That file is <code>NewsCycle-Merriweather.css</code> and it defines all the font rules for the option:</p>
<table class="sourceCode css numberLines"><tr class="sourceCode"><td class="lineNumbers"><pre>1

    <span class="kw">font-family:</span> <span class="st">&#39;News Cycle&#39;</span>, <span class="dt">sans-serif</span>
<span class="kw">}</span></code></pre></td></tr></table>
<p>To use our own fonts, all we need to do is copy that file and replace <code>'News Cycle'</code> and <code>'Merriweather'</code> with our own choices. Perhaps we’d prefer Avenir.</p>

<p>Customizing other aspects of the Timeline <span class="smcp">JS</span> visualization are more challenging but not impossible. These customizations are rather fragile, however, as even the slightest change in the Timeline <span class="smcp">JS</span> implementation could render them ineffective. If it’s important for your page, though, it can be done.</p>
<p>For our example we’ll change the blue color that Timeline <span class="smcp">JS</span> uses in the bottom section of the visualization. It uses that color to highlight the active item, show the time line marker, and for the event line. Finding the specific rules to override takes a bit of detective work with your browser’s developer tools, but here is how we can change the color from blue to green.</p>

Additionally, Stanley Wells argues that the scenes involving more than four characters, \"betray an uncertainty of technique suggestive of inexperience.\" As such, the play is considered to be one of the first Shakespeare composed upon arriving in London (Roger Warren, following E.A.J. Honigmann, suggests he may have written it prior to his arrival) and, as such, he lacked theatrical experience. This places the date of composition as most likely somewhere between 1589 and 1591, by which time it is known he was working on the Henry VI plays","published":"First Folio (1623)","performance":"adaptation by Benjamin Victor performed at David Garrick's Theatre Royal, Drury Lane in 1762.

First record of play as it exists today found in the First Folio (1623)","evidence":"Kier Elam posits a date of 1591 as a terminus post quem for the composition of The Shrew, based on Shakespeare's probable use of two sources published that year; Abraham Ortelius's map of Italy in the Theatrum Orbis Terrarum (4th ed.) and John Florio's Second Fruits. However, scholars continue to debate the relationship between the 1594 A Shrew and the 1623 The Shrew. Some theorise that A Shrew is a reported text, meaning The Shrew must have been written prior to 2 May 1594; others, that A Shrew is an early draft, meaning The Shrew must have been completed sometime after 2 May 1594. There are also arguments that A Shrew may have been a source for The Shrew, that they could be two completely unrelated plays based on the same (now lost) source (the \"Ur-Shrew\" theory), or A Shrew could be an adaptation of The Shrew. Critics remain divided on this issue, and as such, dating the play is extremely difficult.","published":"possible version of play published in quarto in 1594 as A Pleasant Conceited Historie, called The taming of a Shrew (republished in 1596 and 1607). Play as it exists today first published in the First Folio (1623) as The Taming of the Shrew.","performance":"According to Philip Henslowe's diary, a play called The Tamynge of A Shrowe was performed at Newington Butts Theatre on 13 June 1594. This could have been either the 1594 A Shrew or the Shakespearean The Shrew, but as the Admiral's Men and the Lord Chamberlain's Men were sharing the theatre at the time, and as such Shakespeare himself would have been there, scholars tend to assume that it was The Shrew. The Shakespearean version was definitely performed at court before King Charles I and Queen Henrietta Maria on 26 November 1633, where it was described as being \"liked'.","credit":"John Burns","media":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXUelJZSPxY","date":"1590-1594","genre":"Comedies","play":"The Taming of the Shrew"},{"record":"version of the play entered into the Stationers' Register on 12 March 1594 as \"a booke intituled, the firste parte of the Contention of the twoo famous houses of york and Lancaster'.","evidence":"It is known that 3 Henry VI was on stage by June 1592, and it is also known that 3 Henry VI was definitely a sequel to 2 Henry VI, meaning 2 Henry VI must also have been on stage by early 1592.

Groatsworth was registered in the Stationers' Register in September 1592, meaning True Tragedy/3 Henry VI must have been on stage prior to 23 June 1592 as that was when the government shut the London theatres due to an outbreak of plague. To have been on stage by June 1592, the play was most likely written some time in 1591.","published":"version of the play published in octavo in 1595 as The True Tragedie of Richard Duke of Yorke, and the death of good King Henrie the Sixt, with the Whole Contention betweene the two Houses Lancaster and Yorke (republished in quarto in 1600 and 1619).

On 3 March 1592, Henslowe reports seeing a new play entitled Harey Vj (i.e. Henry VI) which could be a reference to 1 Henry VI. An entry is found in the Stationers' Register in September 1598 which refers to \"The first and Second parte of Henry VJ'. Most critics, however, feel this probably refers to what we today call 2 Henry VI and 3 Henry VI, not 1 Henry VI. The first definite record of the play was not until the First Folio in 1623.","evidence":"On 3 March 1592, Philip Henslowe saw a new play entitled Harey Vj, but gives no further information. In August, Thomas Nashe published Piers Penniless his Supplication to the Devil, in which he refers to a play he had recently seen featuring a rousing depiction of Lord Talbot, a major character in 1 Henry VI. Most critics take Nashe's reference to Talbot as proof that the play Henslowe saw was 1 Henry VI. As such, to have been a new play in March 1592, it was most likely written some time in 1591. Furthermore, many critics consider 1 Henry VI to have been written as a prequel to the successful two-part play, The Contention and True Tragedy. Possibly co-written with Thomas Nashe and/or other unidentified dramatists.","published":"First Folio (1623), as The first Part of Henry the Sixt","performance":"possibly on 3 March 1592 at The Rose in Southwark, as seen by Philip Henslowe; earliest definite performance was on 13 March 1738 at Covent Garden in what seems to have been a stand-alone performance.","date":"1591","genre":"Histories","play":"Henry VI, Part 1"},{"record":"Philip Henslowe's diary, 24 January 1594. On 6 February 1594, the play was entered into the Stationers' Register as \"a booke intitled a Noble Roman Historye of Tytus Andronicus'.","evidence":"According to the title page of the 1594 quarto, the play had been performed by Pembroke's Men, a company which ceased performing in September 1593. As such, the play must have been composed some time prior to September. Additionally, it is unlikely to have been written later than June 1592, as that was when the London theatres were closed due to an outbreak of plague. The theatres would remain shut for the better part of two years, not fully reopening until March 1594 and Shakespeare concentrated most of his energies during this period on poetry. As such, the play was most likely composed sometime between late-1591 and early 1592. Possibly co-written with George Peele","published":"version of the play published in quarto in February 1594 as The Most Lamentable Romaine Tragedy of Titus Andronicus (first known printing of a Shakespeare play). The play was republished in quarto in 1600 and 1611. There are only minor differences between the 1594 quarto text and the later 1623 First Folio text (i.e. the 1594 text is not considered a bad quarto or a reported text). The Folio text appears under the title The Lamentable Tragedy of Titus Andronicus.","performance":"on 24 January 1594 at the Rose Theatre in Southwark, as recorded in Henslowe's diary.","credit":"Dusthouse","media":"http://vimeo.com/65065067","date":"1591-1592","genre":"Tragedies","caption":"Dusthouse produced theatre trailer for the Royal Shakespeare Company's production of Titus Andronicus.","play":"Titus Andronicus"},{"record":"version of the play entered into the Stationers' Register on 20 October 1597 as \"a booke intituled, The tragedie of kinge Richard the Third wth the death of the duke of Clarence'.","evidence":"It is known that Richard III was definitely a sequel to 3 Henry VI, which was on-stage by 23 June 1592, hence Richard III must have been written later than early 1592. Additionally, it has been argued that the play contains evidence suggesting it was originally written for Strange's Men, but then rewritten for Pembroke's Men, a company which formed in mid-1592. Also, with the closure of the theatres due to an outbreak of plague in June 1592, the play was unlikely to have been written any later than that, all of which suggests a date of composition as sometime in early-1592.","published":"version of the play published in quarto in December 1597 as The tragedy of King Richard the third. Containing, his treacherous plots against his brother Clarence: the pittiefull murther of his innocent nephewes: his tyrannicall usurpation: with the whole course of his detested life, and most deserved death. The Folio text appears under the title The Tragedy of Richard the Third, with the Landing of Earle Richmond, and the Battell at Bosworth Field.","performance":"The play was performed extensively in Shakespeare's lifetime; it is mentioned in Palladis Tamia in 1598 (as \"Richard the 3.'), and by the time of the First Folio in 1623, had been published in quarto six times (1597, 1598, 1603, 1605, 1612 and 1622), and referenced by multiple writers of the day. Regarding specific performances however, there is little solid evidence. In 1602, John Manningham mentions seeing Richard Burbage playing the role of Richard III, but he offers no further information. The earliest definite performance was at St James's Palace on 16 or 17 November 1633 by the King's Men.","date":"1592","genre":"Histories","play":"Richard III"},{"record":"entered into the Stationers' Register on 1 December 1595 as \"a booke intituled Edward the Third and the blacke prince their warres wth kinge Iohn of Fraunce'.","evidence":"Obviously, the play was written by December 1595. According to the title page of the quarto, it had been performed recently in London, but no company information is provided. This could mean that the company that performed the play had disbanded during the closure of the theatres from June 1592 to March 1594. Furthermore, internal evidence suggests that the play may have been specifically written for Pembroke's Men, who ceased performing in September 1593. This places the date of composition as most likely somewhere between early 1592 and September 1593.","published":"published in quarto in 1596 as The Raigne Of King Edvvard the third (republished in 1599)","performance":"although it is known from the 1596 quarto title page that the play was performed in the 1590s, the earliest recorded performance was not until 6 March 1911 at the Little Theatre in London, directed by Gertrude Kingston and William Poel. However, this production presented only the first half of the play (dealing with the King's infatuation with the Countess of Salisbury). Performed under the title, The King and the Countess, it was presented in a single matinée performance with the anonymous sixteenth century liturgical drama, Jacob and Esau.

However, stylistic and linguistic analysis (proportion of verse to prose, amount of rhyme, use of colloquialism in verse, and a rare word test) has placed it closer to the composition of Richard II and Romeo and Juliet, both of which were written in 1594 or 1595. More specifically, the limited setting (it is one of only two Shakespeare plays to observe the Classical unities) and the brevity of the play (Shakespeare's shortest at 1777 lines), along with the great abundance of legal terminology, suggests to some critics the probability of it being written especially for the Gray's Inn performance, which would place its composition in the latter half of 1594. If it was written for Gray's Inn, it most likely represents the first play by Shakespeare which was specifically commissioned. In this case, that commission could have come from Henry Wriothesley, Earl of Southampton, a member of the Inns of Court, and Shakespeare's patron.","published":"First Folio (1623)","performance":"probably on Innocents Day, 28 December 1594 at Gray's Inn (one of the four London Inns of Court).

So that Night was begun, and continued to the end, in nothing but Confusion and Errors; whereupon, it was ever afterwards called, The Night of Errors.\" As Comedy of Errors is indeed based on Menaechmus, this is almost universally accepted as a reference to an otherwise unrecorded performance of the play, probably by Shakespeare's own company, the newly formed Lord Chamberlain's Men.","credit":"Nathan Klaus","media":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/21932462@N08/2650112130/","date":"1594","genre":"Comedies","caption":"Genesius Guild's 2008 production of \"A Comedy of Errors,\" performed in Rock Island's Lincoln Park.","play":"The Comedy of Errors"},{"record":"a version of the play was published in quarto in 1598, although the exact date is unknown as it was never entered into the Stationers' Register.

Additionally, the play is mentioned in Meres' Palladis Tamia (registered on 7 September, with a dedication dated 10 October). It is unknown exactly which one of these three constitutes the first official record of the play.","evidence":"Obviously, the play was written by Christmas 1597, but narrowing the date further has proved difficult, with most efforts focusing upon stylistic evidence. Traditionally, it was seen as one of Shakespeare's earliest plays (Charles Gildon wrote in 1710; \"since it is one of the worst of Shakespeare's Plays, nay I think I may say the very worst, I cannot but think it is his first.') For much of the eighteenth century, it tended to be dated 1590, until Malone's newly constructed chronology in 1778, which dated it 1594. In his 1930 chronology, E.K. Chambers found the play to be more sophisticated than Malone had allowed for, and dated it 1595. Today most scholars tend to concur with a date of 1594-1595, and the play is often grouped with the \"lyrical plays'; Richard II, Romeo and Juliet and A Midsummer Night's Dream, because of its prolific use of rhyming. These four plays are argued to represent a phase of Shakespeare's career where he was experimenting with rhyming iambic pentameter as an alternative form to standard blank verse; Richard II has more rhymed verse than any other history play (19.1%), Romeo and Juliet more than any other tragedy (16.6%) and Love's Labour's and Midsummer Night more than any other comedy (43.1% and 45.5% respectively). All four tend to be dated to 1594/1595. In support of this, Ants Oras' pause test places the play after Richard III, which is usually dated 1592. Furthermore, Taylor finds possible allusions to the Gray's Inn revels of December 1594 (specifically the Muscovite masque in Act 5, Scene 2), and also finds plausible Geoffrey Bullough's argument that the satire of the King of Navarre (loosely based on Henry of Navarre, who was associated with oath breaking after abjuring Protestantism in 1593) favours a date after December 1594, when Henry survived an assassination attempt.","published":"version of the play published in quarto in 1598 as A Pleasant Conceited Comedie called Loves labors lost (the first known printing of a Shakespearean play to include his name on the title page).

One is in Meres' Palladis Tamia, the other is on a list by Christopher Hunt, dated August 1603, which gives a list of published plays sold by an Exeter bookseller. Up until 1953, only Meres' reference was known, until Hunt's two pages of handwriting were discovered in the backing of a copy of Thomas Gataker's Certaine Sermones. The discovery was handed over to T.W. Baldwin, who published his findings in 1957 as Shakespeare's Love's Labour's Won. The title suggests the play was written as a sequel to Love's Labour's Lost, which is partially supported by the unusually open-ended nature of that play, hence Love's Labour's Won's position in the Oxford chronology. However, whether the play ever existed has been debated, with some critics speculating that it is simply another name for one of Shakespeare's known plays, a situation similar to Henry VIII, which was originally performed with the title All is True. As Meres refers to The Two Gentlemen of Verona, The Comedy of Errors and The Merchant of Venice, prior to the discovery of the Hunt reference, a common suggestion was The Taming of the Shrew, but as Hunt mentions this play, it could not be Love's Labour's Won. Although Much Ado About Nothing, All's Well That Ends Well and Troilus and Cressida have also been cited as possibilities, these plays tend to be dated later than 1598 (much later in the case of Troilus, although the argument is that Love's Labour's Won is an early draft), and as there are no other pre-1598 Shakespearean comedies with which to equate it, it seems certain that the play did exist, that it was performed and published, but that it has since been lost.","published":"published in quarto some time prior to 1603","performance":"there are no recorded performances of the play","date":"1595-1596","genre":"Comedies","play":"Love's Labour's Won"},{"record":"entered into the Stationers' Register on 29 August 1597 as \"the Tragedye of Richard the Second'.","evidence":"Richard II is usually seen as one of the \"lyrical plays', along with Love's Labour's Lost, Romeo and Juliet and A Midsummer Night's Dream; four plays in which Shakespeare used rhymed iambic pentameter more than anywhere else in his career. The four plays also include elaborate punning, rhetorical patterning, a general avoidance of colloquialisms and a high volume of metrical regularity. All four of these plays tend to be dated to 1594-1595. Also important in dating the play is Samuel Daniel's The First Four Books of the Civil Wars, which was entered into the Stationers' Register on 11 October 1594, and published in early 1595. Although some scholars have suggested that Daniel used Shakespeare as a source, which would mean the play was written somewhat earlier than 1594, most agree that Shakespeare used Daniel, especially in some of the later scenes, meaning the play could not have been written earlier than 1595.","published":"version of the play published in quarto in 1597 as The Tragedie of King Richard the second (republished in 1598 (twice), 1608 and 1615).

However, some scholars argue that the reference could be to a painting, not a play, whilst others argue there is no evidence that \"K. Richard\" necessarily refers to Richard II, suggesting it could refer to Richard III or to another play entirely. There is no complete consensus on this issue, although most scholars do tend to favour the Richard II theory. The earliest definite performance was at the Globe Theatre on 7 February 1601, organised by the Earl of Essex in a performance probably intended to inspire his supporters on the eve of his armed rebellion against Queen Elizabeth.

There is also the problem of the Ur-Hamlet, a possible source used by Shakespeare, now lost. Others however, feel that Ur-Hamlet (if it ever existed) was most likely an early draft. Hamlet was written sometime between September 1598 (as it was not included in Meres' Palladis Tamia) and July 1602 (when it was registered in the Stationers Register). Furthermore, internal references to Julius Caesar would indicate the play could not have been written any earlier than September 1599. Additionally, in his 1598 copy of an edition of Geoffrey Chaucer's works, Gabriel Harvey has written that Shakespeare's \"Lucrece & his tragedie of Hamlet, prince of Denmarke, have it in them, to please the wiser sort'. Harvey also mentions the Earl of Essex as still alive, which would suggest he wrote the note prior to 25 February 1601, when Essex was executed. This would seem to narrow the date of composition to between September 1599 and February 1601; however, not all scholars accept the veracity of Harvey's note. Internal evidence in the play has also been cited, usually as illustrative of a date of composition of 1600 or 1601. As such, many scholars interpret the available evidence as suggestive of a date of initial composition sometime in 1600, with subsequent revisions.

A further possible source for the play has evoked some disagreement however. Whilst many scholars feel that Shakespeare used the anonymous play The True Chronicle History of King Leir (entered into the Stationers' Register on 8 May 1605), and hence must have been written between May 1605 and December 1606, others argue that the relationship between the two plays has been inverted, and The True Chronicle History of King Leir was actually written to capitalise on the success of Shakespeare's play, which was probably written in 1603 or 1604.

Several possible topical references to the Gunpowder Plot of 1605 have been proposed and debated among scholars, but these references have not been universally accepted. In 1790, Edward Malone dated the play to 1606, and the vast majority of critics agree with this date even while acknowledging that little conclusive evidence exists, though the date seems correct in the context of Shakespeare's other work of the period. One suggested allusion supporting a date in late 1606 is the first witch's dialogue about a sailor's wife: \"'Aroint thee, witch!\" the rump-fed ronyon cries./Her husband's to Aleppo gone, master o' the Tiger\" (1.6-7). This has been thought to allude to the Tiger, a ship that returned to England 27 June 1606 after a disastrous voyage in which many of the crew were killed by pirates. A few lines later the witch speaks of the sailor, \"He shall live a man forbid:/Weary se'nnights nine times nine\" (1.21-2). The real ship was at sea 567 days, the product of 7x9x9, which has been taken as a confirmation of the allusion, which if correct, confirms that the play could not have been written any earlier than July 1606. A. R. Braunmuller, however, in the New Cambridge edition, finds the 1605-6 arguments inconclusive, and argues only for an earliest date of 1603. Further complicating the dating of Macbeth is the fact that the play shows evidence of later revisions by Middleton, particularly in the witch scenes.","published":"First Folio (1623) as The Tragedie of Macbeth","performance":"possibly in April 1611, recorded by Simon Forman","date":"1606","genre":"Tragedies","play":"Macbeth"},{"record":"entered into the Stationers' Register on 20 May 1608","evidence":"","published":"First Folio (1623) as The Tragedie of Antony and Cleopatra","performance":"according to the 1669 records for the Lord Chamberlain's Men, the play had recently been performed at Blackfriars, but no further information is given; earliest definite performance in 1759 when it was staged by David Garrick.","date":"1606","genre":"Tragedies","play":"Antony and Cleopatra"},{"record":"First Folio (1623)","evidence":"","published":"First Folio (1623)","performance":"1741 at Goodman's Fields Theatre, directed by Henry Giffard.","date":"1606-1607","genre":"Comedies","play":"All's Well That Ends Well"},{"record":"version of the play entered into the Stationers' Register on 20 May 1608","evidence":"Because the play was not included in the First Folio, there has always been doubt as to whether or not Shakespeare actually wrote it at all. It first appears together with Shakespeare's other plays in the second issue of the Third Folio of 1664. In a contested field, the most widely accepted theory today is that Shakespeare collaborated on the play with another playwright, probably his younger colleague, George Wilkins. There is no complete agreement what the motives or mechanism of this collaboration were. In 1608, Wilkins published a prose narrative of Pericles purporting to be a narrative version of the play and which contains numerous phrases that seem to recall specific lines in the play, suggesting that work on the play preceded his composition of the prose version.

Shakespeare's treatment of the grain riots is strikingly reminiscent of the Midlands corn riots of 1607. Though Menenius' fable of the belly was used in other contemporary works, the wording of Menenius's speech about the body politic is derived from William Camden's Remaines (1605). Two possible echoes of George Chapman's Iliad (registered 14 November 1608) support a date of 1608-9. A reference to \"the coal of fire upon ice\" (1.1.170) is a possible allusion to the winter of 1607-08, when the frost was so severe that vendors set up booths on the frozen Thames river and pans of coals were placed on the ice so that pedestrians could warm themselves. An allusion to the complaints about Hugh Myddelton's project to bring water to London has also been detected in Martius' warning to the patricians (3.1.98-9). Taylor says that the cumulative internal evidence all points to a composition date of no earlier than spring of 1608, while others favour late 1608 to early 1609. Several allusions in other works establish a terminal date of composition: Ben Jonson's Epicœne, or The silent woman, composed in late 1609, mocks a peculiar phrase in the play, and Phantasma (registered 6 February 1609), written by Robert Armin, a member of the King's Men from 1599 to 1610, contains a close literary parallel.

<h2 id="summing-up">Summing Up</h2>
<p>In this chapter we’ve looked at a wide range of approaches for creating time line visualizations. The most familiar approach relies on an open source library, but we also considered two other options. In one, we developed the code for a time line from scratch, giving us complete control over its appearance and behavior. For the other extreme, we examined a popular open source web component. Pages normally use that component by embedding <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> elements in the page, but we also saw that it’s possible to take the open source code and integrate it more seamlessly in our pages, even altering the visual styles if necessary.</p>
