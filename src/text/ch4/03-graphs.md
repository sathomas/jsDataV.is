## Showing Relationships with Network Graphs

Visualizations don't always focus on the actual data values; sometimes the most interesting aspects of a data set are the relationships among its members. The relationships between members of a social network, for example, might be the most important feature of that network. To visualize these types of relationships, we can use a _network graph._ Network graphs represent objects, generally known as _nodes,_ as points or circles. Lines or arcs (technically called _edges_) connect these nodes to indicate relationships.

Constructing network graphs can be a bit tricky, as the underlying mathematics are not always trivial. Fortunately the [sigmajs](http://sigmajs.org) library takes care of most of the complicated calculations. By using that library, we can create full-featured network graphs with just a little bit of JavaScript. For our example, we'll consider one critic's list of the [Top 25 Jazz Albums of All Time](http://www.thejazzresource.com/top_25_jazz_albums.html). Several musicians performed on more than one of these albums, and a network graph let's us explore those connections.

### Step 1: Include the Required Libraries

The sigmajs library does not depend on any other JavaScript libraries, so we don't need any other included scripts. It is not, however, available on common Content Distribution Networks. Consequently, we'll have to serve it from our own web host.

``` {.html .numberLines}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title></title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="graph"></div>
    <script src="js/sigma.min.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

As you can see, we've set aside a `<div>` in line 8 to hold our graph. We've also included the JavaScript library as the last part of the `<body>` element, as that provides the best browser performance.

> Note: In most of the examples in this book, we included steps you can take to make your visualizations compatible with older web browsers such as Internet Explorer 8. In this case, however, those approaches degrade performance so severely that they are rarely workable. To view the network graph visualization, your users will need a modern browser.

### Step 2: Prepare the Data

Our data on the top 25 jazz albums looks like the following snippet. We're only showing the first couple of albums below, but you can see the full list in the book's [source code](https://github.com/sathomas/jsDataV.is-source).

``` {.javascript .numberLines}
var albums = [
  {
    album: "Miles Davis - Kind of Blue",
    musicians: [
      "Cannonball Adderley",
      "Paul Chambers",
      "Jimmy Cobb",
      "John Coltrane",
      "Miles Davis",
      "Bill Evans"
    ]
  },{
    album: "John Coltrane - A Love Supreme",
    musicians: [
      "John Coltrane",
      "Jimmy Garrison",
      "Elvin Jones",
      "McCoy Tyner"
    ]
  // Data set continues...
```

That's not exactly the structure that sigmajs requires. We could convert it to a sigmajs <span class="smcp">JSON</span> data structure in bulk, but there's really no need. Instead, as we'll see in the next step, we can simply pass data to the library one element at a time.

### Step 3: Define the Graph's Nodes

Now we're ready to use the library to construct our graph. We start by initializing the library and indicating where it should construct the graph. That parameter is the `id` of the `<div>` element set aside to hold the visualization.

``` {.javascript .numberLines}
var s = new sigma("graph");
```

Now we can continue by adding the nodes to the graph. In our case each album is a node. As we add a node to the graph, we give it a unique identifier (which must be a string), a label, and a position. Figuring out an initial position can be a bit tricky for arbitrary data. In a few steps we'll look at an approach that makes the initial position less critical. For now, though, we'll simply spread our albums in a circle using basic trigonometry. The `radius` value is roughly half of the width of the container. We can also give each node a different size, but for our purposes it's fine to set every album's size to `1`.

``` {.javascript .numberLines}
for (var idx=0; idx<albums.length; idx++) {
    var theta = idx*2*Math.PI / albums.length;
    s.graph.addNode({
        id: ""+idx,   // Note: 'id' must be a string
        label: albums[idx].album,
        x: radius*Math.sin(theta),
        y: radius*Math.cos(theta),
        size: 1
    });
}
```

Finally, after defining the graph, we tell the library to draw it.

``` {.javascript .numberLines}
s.refresh();
```

With figure NEXTFIGURENUMBER now have a nicely drawn circle of the top 25 jazz albums of all time. In our initial attempt some of the labels may get in each other's way, but we'll address that shortly.

<figure>
<div id="graph-1" style="width:1000px;height:450px;position:relative;left:-300px;"></div>
<figcaption>Sigmajs draws graph nodes as small circles.</figcaption>
</figure>

If you try out this visualization in the browser, you'll notice that the sigmajs library automatically supports panning the graph, and users can mover their mouse pointer over individual nodes to highlight the node labels.

### Step 4: Connect the Nodes with Edges

Now that we have the nodes drawn in a circle, it's time to connect them with edges. In our case an edge, or connection between two albums, represents a musician that performed on both of the albums. To find those edges, we iterate through the albums in four stages.

1. Loop through each album as a potential source of a connection (line 1).
2. For the source album, loop through all musicians (line 3).
3. For each musician, loop through all of the remaining albums as potential targets for a connection (line 5).
4. For each target album, loop through all the musicians looking for a match (line 7).

For the last step we're using the `some()` method of JavaScript arrays. That method takes a function as a parameter, and it returns `true` if that function itself returns `true` for any element in the array.

``` {.javascript .numberLines}
for (var srcIdx=0; srcIdx<albums.length; srcIdx++) {
  var src = albums[srcIdx];
  for (var mscIdx=0; mscIdx<src.musicians.length; mscIdx++) {
    var msc = src.musicians[mscIdx];
    for (var tgtIdx=srcIdx+1; tgtIdx<albums.length; tgtIdx++) {
      var tgt = albums[tgtIdx];
      if (tgt.musicians.some(function(tgtMsc) {return tgtMsc === msc;})) {
        s.graph.addEdge({
          id: srcIdx + "." + mscIdx + "-" + tgtIdx,
          source: ""+srcIdx,
          target: ""+tgtIdx
        })
      }
    }
  }
}
```

We'll want to insert this code before we `refresh` the graph. When we've done that, we'll have a connected circle of albums as in figure NEXTFIGURENUMBER.

<figure>
<div id="graph-2" style="width:1000px;height:450px;position:relative;left:-300px;"></div>
<figcaption>Sigmajs can then connect graph nodes using lines to represent edges.</figcaption>
</figure>

Again, you can pan and zoom the graph to focus on different parts.

### Step 5: Automating the Layout

So far we've manually placed the nodes in our graph in a circle. That's not a terrible approach, but it can make it hard to discern some of the connections. It would be better if we could let the library calculate a more optimal layout than the simple circle. That's exactly what we'll do now.

The mathematics behind this approach go by the name of "force directed graphing." In a nutshell, the algorithm proceeds by treating the graph's nodes and edges as physical objects subject to real forces such as gravity and electromagnetism. It simulates the effect of those forces, pushing and prodding the nodes into new positions on the graph.

The underlying algorithm may be complicated, but sigmajs makes it easy to employ. First we have to add an optional plugin to the sigmajs library. That's the `forceAtlas2` plugin in line 10 below.

``` {.html .numberLines data-line='10'}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title></title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="graph"></div>
    <script src="js/sigma.min.js"></script>
    <script src="js/sigma.layout.forceAtlas2.min.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

Now, instead of simply refreshing the graph when we're ready to display it, we start the force directed algorithm, which perioudically refreshes the display while it performs its simulation. We also need to stop the algorithm after it's had a chance to run for awhile. In our case 1.5 seconds (`1500 ms`) is plenty of time.

``` {.javascript .numberLines}
s.startForceAtlas2();
setTimeout(function() { s.stopForceAtlas2(); }, 1500);
```

As a result, our albums start out in their original circle, but quickly migrate to a position that makes it much easier to identify the connections. Some of the top albums are tightly connected, indicating that have many musicians in common. A few, however, remain isolated. Their musicians only make the list once.

<figure>
<div id="graph-3" style="width:800px;height:600px;position:relative;left:-100px;"></div>
<figcaption>Force direction positions the graph nodes automatically.</figcaption>
</figure>

Note that some of the text labels overlap each other. The sigmajs library isn't intelligent enough to eliminate this overlap, but we can minimize it by adjusting the time that we allow the algorithm to run.

### Step 6: Adding Interactivity

We can build on this last step by adding an additional level of interactivity. In addition to panning the entire graph, we'll let users click on individual nodes to highlight their connections. To do that we need a function that responds to clicks on the node elements.

``` {.javascript .numberLines}
s.bind('clickNode', function(ev) {
  var nodeIdx = ev.data.node.id;
  // Code continues...
});
```

Within that function, the `ev.data.node.id` property gives us the node that the user clicked. We can then scan through all the graph's edges to see if they connect to that node. If the edge does connect to the node, we can change it's color to something other than the default (line 5). Otherwise, we change the color back to the default (line 7).

``` {.javascript .numberLines data-line='5,7'}
s.bind('clickNode', function(ev) {
  var nodeIdx = ev.data.node.id;
  s.graph.edges().forEach(function(edge) {
    if ((edge.target === nodeIdx) || (edge.source === nodeIdx)) {
      edge.color = '#555';
    } else {
      edge.color = '#ec5148';
    }
  });
  // Code continues...
});
```

While we're scanning through the edges, we can also build up a list of neighbors to the clicked node. A neighbor is a node at the other end of a connected edge. We build the array of neighbors in lines 7 and 8 below. Note that we're not bothering to distinguish the node itself from its neighbors in this array. It won't cause any harm to have the node included.

``` {.javascript .numberLines data-line='7,8'}
s.bind('clickNode', function(ev) {
  var nodeIdx = ev.data.node.id;
  var neighbors = [];
  s.graph.edges().forEach(function(edge) {
    if ((edge.target === nodeIdx) || (edge.source === nodeIdx)) {
      edge.color = '#555';
      neighbors.push(edge.target);
      neighbors.push(edge.source);
    } else {
      edge.color = '#ec5148';
    }
  });
});
```

To wrap up our click event handler, we can now scan through the list of nodes. If the node is a neighbor, change its color as well (line 15). And finally, once we've set all the colors appropriately, we refresh the graph.

``` {.javascript .numberLines data-line='15'}
s.bind('clickNode', function(ev) {
  var nodeIdx = ev.data.node.id;
  var neighbors = [];
  s.graph.edges().forEach(function(edge) {
    if ((edge.target === nodeIdx) || (edge.source === nodeIdx)) {
      edge.color = '#555';
      neighbors.push(edge.target);
      neighbors.push(edge.source);
    } else {
      edge.color = '#ec5148';
    }
  });
  s.graph.nodes().forEach(function(node) {
    if (neighbors.some(function(n){return n === node.id})) {
      node.color = '#555';
    } else {
      node.color = '#ec5148';
    }
  });
  g.refresh();
});
```

Now we have a fully interactive network graph in figure NEXTFIGURENUMBER. Our users can pan, zoom, click, and tap to their heart's content.
