## Summing Up

In this chapter we've looked at a wide range of approaches for creating timeline visualizations. The most familiar approach relies on an open source library, but we also considered two other options. In one, we developed the code for a timeline from scratch, which gave us complete control over its appearance and behavior. For the other extreme, we examined a popular open source web component. Pages normally use that component by embedding `<iframe>` elements in the page, but we also saw that it's possible to take the open source code and integrate it more seamlessly in our pages, even altering the visual styles if necessary.
