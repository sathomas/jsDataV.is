# Chapter 6: Visualizing Geographic Data

Humans crave context when evaluating data, so it's important to provide that context when it's available. In the previous chapter we saw how timelines can provide one frame of reference; now we'll examine another equally important context: place. Many times the data that we want to visualize includes geographic information. The data set may include a categorical value representing a geographic region such as a country or state, or the data set may include geographic coordinates. Both of those cases call for a map-based visualization. The examples in this chapter consider both types of map-based visualizations. The first two show different techniques for using geographic regions as categorical data. The final two illustrate the use of maps as context for other data. In particular, we'll see

* How to use special map fonts to create maps with minimal JavaScript.
* How to manipulate Scalable Vector Graphic (SVG) image maps with JavaScript.
* How to use a simple mapping library to add maps to web pages.
* How to integrate a full-featured map library into a visualization.
