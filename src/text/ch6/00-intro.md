# Chapter 6: Visualizing Geographic Data

Humans crave context when evaluating data, so it's important to provide that context when it's available. In the previous chapter we saw how timelines can provide one frame of reference; now we'll examine another equally important context: place. If a data set includes geographic coordinates or it has values that correspond to different geographic regions, you'll want to provide geographic context using a map-based visualization. The examples in this chapter consider two types of map-based visualizations. The first two examples show different techniques for using geographic regions as categorical data. The final two illustrate the use of maps as context for other data. In particular, we'll see

* How to use special map fonts to create maps with minimal JavaScript.
* How to manipulate Scalable Vector Graphic (<span class="smcp">SVG</span>) image maps with JavaScript.
* How to use a simple mapping library to add maps to web pages.
* How to integrate a full-featured map library into a visualization.
