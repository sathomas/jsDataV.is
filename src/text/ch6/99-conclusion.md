## Summing Up

In this chapter we've looked at several visualizations based on maps. In the first two examples, geographic regions were the main subjects of the visualization, and we built choropleth maps to compare and contrast those regions. Map fonts are quick and convenient, but only if they're available for the regions the visualization needs. Although it usually takes more effort, we have far more control over the map regions if we use Scalable Vector Graphics to create our own custom maps. Unlike other image formats, <span class="smcp">SVG</span> can be easily manipulated in a web page with just <span class="smcp">CSS</span> and JavaScript. This chapter also looked at examples based on traditional mapping libraries. Mapping libraries are especially convenient when your data sets include latitude and longitude values, as the libraries take care of the complicated mathematics required to position those points on a two-dimensional projection. As we saw, some libraries are relatively simple yet are perfectly capable of mapping a data set. Full featured libraries such as Leaflet offer much more power and customization, and we relied on that extensibility for a custom, animated map.
