## Summing Up

Although this chapter takes a different approach than the rest of the book, its ultimate focus is still on data visualizations. As we've seen in earlier chapters (and as you'll certainly encounter in your own projects), the raw data for our visualizations isn't always perfect as delivered. Sometimes we need to clean the data by removing invalid values, and other times we need to rearrange or transform it so that it's appropriate for our visualization libraries.

The Underscore.js library contains a wealth of tools and utilities to help with those tasks. It let's us easily manage arrays, modify objects, and transform collections. Furthermore, Underscore.js supports an underlying philosophy based on functional programming, so our code that uses Underscore.js remains highly readable and resistant to bugs and defects.
